    abstract = {Recent work on the semantics of measure phrases has grappled with the insight that expressions like \emph{six feet tall}---often taken to be the prototypical and most theoretically revealing cases of MP modification---are in fact unusual, and that differential MPs (as in \emph{six feet taller}) are actually the unmarked case (Schwarzschild 2005 directly, and more indirectly Kennedy \& Levin (2008) and Svenonius \& Kennedy 2006). This talk provides further evidence for this view, primarily from the grammar of \emph{by} MPs across categories, and proposes a way of drawing a sortal distinction between differential degrees and ordinary ones in which differential MP modification emerges as grammatically simpler than its non-differential counterpart.}
