    abstract = {This chapter considers, in light of the previous chapters, a number of crosscategorial phenomena not yet addressed. In section 2, we confront expressions that measure individuals by their amount, and the comparatives built out of these expressions. This requires combining our standing assumptions about degree semantics with assumptions and DPs an individuals. Section 3 examines the issue of cross-categorial gradability more broadly, focusing on verbs and nouns, both of which seem to be gradable in different ways and one of which introduces into the discussion some new parallels between individuals and events. Section 4 addresses the problem of crosscategorial modifiers that hedge or reinforce a claim, but can't be readily assimilated to the degree modifiers we've already encountered in other domains. Section 5 focuses on an issue we've systematically set aside throughout the book: nonrestrictive interpretations of modifiers, which turn out to extend far beyond relative clauses, their traditional home. Part of that entails struggling with what 'nonrestrictive' actually means. Finally, section 6 examines the phenomenon an aspect of meaning that is inherently subjective in a particular way, one that gives rise to the possibility of interlocutors contradicting each other truth-conditionally without being at odds with each other pragmatically.},
