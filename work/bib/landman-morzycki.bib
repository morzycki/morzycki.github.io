    abstract = {In English, expressions introduced by \emph{such}---as in \emph{such a dog}---can be taken to involve instantiations of a contextually-provided kind (in the sense of Carlson 1977). Such an understanding is quite natural in part because it is well-established that reference to kinds is possible in the nominal domain. Surprisingly, though, in Polish the analogue of English such---\emph{taki}, as in \emph{taki pies} (lit. `such-\textsc{masc} dog')---also occurs in its bare form in the verbal domain, as \emph{tak} in e.g. \emph{ta\'nczy\'c} (lit. `dance-\textsc{inf} such'; `dance that way'). It is possible to extend the kind-reference analysis of adnominal \emph{taki} to its adverbial counterpart by exploiting the parallelism between individuals and Davidsonian events. But this quite straightforward path leads to an understanding of adverbial \emph{tak} in terms of a less familiar and perhaps unexpected notion: reference to kinds of events. This paper formulates an analysis framed in these terms and explores its consequences for the semantics of manner.}
