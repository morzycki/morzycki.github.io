%Here are some FAQs and their answers:
%
%|How do you pronounce your name?|
%    In 
%    [IPA](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa), it's <span 
%    class="IPA">[ˈmɑɹsɪnmɔɹˈzɪki]</span>. (If you can't 
%    read IPA, you should take a linguistics course. If you see a series of
%    boxes due to font problems, do not assume my name is pronounced as a
%    series of boxes.) This is Anglicized Polish. 
%    %It's Polish. (My name, not your browser.) 
%    People who know anything about Polish understandably find it appalling.
%    %are horrified by this pronunciation. 
%    The non-Anglicized version is <span
%    class="IPA">[ˈmart͡ɕinmɔˈʐɨt͡ski]</span>, but virtually no one calls me
%    that.
%    
%|Intellectually, whose fault are you?|
%    My dissertation committee was chaired by Angelika Kratzer, and I worked a
%    lot with Barbara Partee, Kyle Johnson, and Lisa Matthewson.
%    As an undergrad, I did a thesis with Sandy Chung. 
%    %My undergrad thesis advisor was Sandy Chung.
%    Please don't blame any of them.

%%If you know anything at all about Polish you will be horrified and offended by this pronunciation. In actual Polish, it would be []. I was imported into the US at age six. This is not an age at which it's easy to persuade people to pronounce Polish names in Polish, so it got Anglicized pretty fast. 

%I used to have a page of links and linguistics resources, but that seems somehow retrograde these days---one just doesn't _do_ that anymore, though I'm not entirely sure why. Nevertheless, here are a few remnants of it: this essay by the philosopher John Perry on '[structured procrastination][procrastination]' that I think may be deeply wise and this now out-of-date but still potentially useful starting point for doing [linguistics using LaTeX][LaTeX_Penn].

%: ADD?:
%: 
%:   • intellectual biography of some kind, including mention of Angelika,
%:     Sandy, etc
%:   • deal on my name, w/ ipa pronunciation and Polish story?
%:   • 'welcome' or some such?
%:   • more explicit contact info, w/ 'by email', 'by snail mail', etc?
%:   • conceivably some separate 'about me' thing? with lies and truth
%:     intermingled? 'briefly served as the first female pope' etc., end with
%:     'some of this was true'
%:   • add 'known allergies' or 'blood type' to list of info? maybe too subtle
%:   • list of best fortune cookies? maybe scanned? 
%:   • link to ridiculous photos of east lansing, maybe just by clicking on
%:     'EL'? 
%:   • on teaching page, maybe mention hampshire stuff, including the crazy
%:     course?
%:   • a FAQ thing including how to pronunce name; what's the deal on the
%:     dept name; what can I do with a linguistics major, etc.
%:
