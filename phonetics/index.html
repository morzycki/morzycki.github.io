<h1>Phonetics stuff</h1>

<h3 id="x_ray_films">X-ray films</h3>

<p>These are x-ray films of vocal tracts making various odd declarations, all
  from the <a href="http://psyc.queensu.ca/~munhallk/05_database.htm" id=
  "x_ray_database" >X-Ray Database page</a> at the <a href=
  "http://psyc.queensu.ca/~munhallk" id="queens_lab" >Queen&rsquo;s
  University Speech Perception and Production Laboratory</a>. (These are
  links to the QuickTime versions; other formats are available on the
  original website.)</p>

<ul>

  <li>An anonymous 38-year-old male vocal tract asks the age-old question <a
    href="soggynet.mov">&lsquo;Why did Ken set the soggy net on top of his
    deck?&rsquo;</a>. (There does not appear to be an x-ray film of
    Ken&rsquo;s vocal tract explaining his soggy-net-placement decisions,
    unfortunately.)</li>

  <li>The anonymous 38-year-old male vocal tract says a variety of other
    things, too. You can watch <a href="fullxray.mov">the full
    recording</a>.</li>

  <li>An anonymous 26-year-old male vocal tract says: <a href=
    "10below.mov">&lsquo;It&rsquo;s ten below outside&rsquo;</a>.
    (Meteorologically shocking revelation: this was recorded in Quebec.)</li>

  <li>An anonymous female vocal tract of unknown age announces in Canadian
    French that <a href="leboulanger.mov">&lsquo;Le boulanger but onze
    bi&egrave;res&rsquo;</a> (&lsquo;The baker drank eleven
    beers&rsquo;).</li>

</ul>

<h3 id="vocal_folds">Vocal folds</h3>

<p>This is what vibrating vocal folds look like (in slow motion):</p>

<p><img src="vocalfolds_horiz.gif" alt="[Vocal folds in action]" /></p>

<p>This is from the <a href=
  "http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/linguistics/faciliti/uclaplab.html" id=
  "ucla_lab" >UCLA Phonetics Lab</a> <a href=
  "http://www.humnet.ucla.edu/humnet/linguistics/faciliti/demos/demos.html"
  id="ucla_demos" >demos and illustrations</a> page.</p>

<h3 id="elaborate_multimedia_thing">Elaborate multimedia thing</h3>

<p>You might want to play with <a href=
  "http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/english/frameset.html" id=
  "multimedia_toy" >this multimedia dingus</a> about the phonetics of English
  from the University of Iowa. There are IPA symbols bouncing around,
  animations of various sounds being articulated, and videos of a very
  earnest-looking person&mdash;whose insides you are not forced to look
  at&mdash;making those sounds.</p>

<p>A warning, though: The terminology it uses varies slightly from what
  we&rsquo;ve been using in class. The main difference is that all places of
  articulation in which the tongue is the active articulator (the chunk of
  meat that&rsquo;s moving) are prefixed with <em>lingua-</em>. I don&rsquo;t
  know why this site in particular has this apparent tongue fixation, but
  this illustrates a more general fact: there is variation in phonetic
  terminology. Even apart from that, the same sound might be characterized in
  different ways depending on what is relevant in a particular context. For
  example, one might call attention to the fact that English [t] is made with
  the blade of the tongue by using the term &lsquo;laminal&rsquo;, and
  describing this sound as a &lsquo;laminal voiceless alveolar
  stop&rsquo;.</p>

<p>(There is also a <a href=
  "http://www.uiowa.edu/~acadtech/phonetics/spanish/frameset.html" id=
  "spanish_toy" >Spanish version</a> of this site. You probably
  shouldn&rsquo;t look at it, though, until you&rsquo;re relatively confident
  of your grasp of the basics of the phonetics of English.)</p>
<!-- <h2 id="sounds_of_the_worlds">Sounds of the Worlds Languages</h2>

Examples of various sounds being made by native speakers of languages that
have them are available here. -->

<h3 id="full_ipa_chart">Full IPA chart</h3>

<p>Here is the <a href=
  "http://web.uvic.ca/ling/resources/ipa/charts/IPAlab/IPAlab.htm" id=
  "ipa_chart" >chart</a> that reflects all the standard symbols in the IPA.
  Definitely don&rsquo;t look at this unless you have a handle on what
  we&rsquo;re doing in class. This version is actually clickable, so you can
  hear examples of various sounds. <!-- If you do, though, you might want to
  consider ways in which what we're doing departs from the system here, and
  why it might make sense to do so. --></p>
