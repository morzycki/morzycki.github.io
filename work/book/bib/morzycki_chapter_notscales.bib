    abstract = {One could be forgiven for getting the impression that the semantics of adjectives is, above all, the semantics of scales. Yet this would be a misimpression, as this chapter strives to demonstrate. It is about the lexical semantics of adjectives, but it is \emph{not} about scales. Section 2 presents a typology of adjectives according the effect they have on nouns they modify. Section 3 sketches various theoretical approaches that shed light on that typology. Section 4 begins the exploration of particular analytically-tractable classes of adjectives, focusing on adjectives that interact in interesting ways with their nouns. Section 5 continues the exploration of adjective classes, but shifts the focus to adjectives with surprising scope properties. Finally, section 6 considers additional issues closely linked to the syntax of adjectives, including their relative order and the positions they can occupy.},
