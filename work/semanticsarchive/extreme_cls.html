  <title>Morzycki &middot; &lsquo;Degree Modification of Extreme
    Adjectives&rsquo;</title>

  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

  <meta name="abstract" content="This paper argues that degree modifiers such
    as 'flat-out', 'downright', 'positively', and 'straight-up' constitute a
    distinct natural class specialized for modifying extreme adjectives (such
    as 'gigantic', 'fantastic', or 'gorgeous'), and that extreme adjectives
    themselves come in two varieties: ones that encode extremeness as part of
    their lexical semantics and ones that can acquire it on the basis of
    contextual factors. These facts suggest that a theory is required of what
    it means for an adjective to be 'extreme' in the relevant sense. I
    propose one, based on the idea that in any given context, we restrict our
    attention to a particular salient portion of a scale. To reflect this, I
    suggest that quantification over degrees is---like quantification in
    other domains---contextually restricted. Extreme adjectives and
    corresponding degree modifiers can thus both be understood as a means of
    signaling that a degree lies outside a contextually-provided range." />

<p class="abs">This paper argues that degree modifiers such as
  <em>flat-out</em>, <em>downright</em>, <em>positively</em>, and
  <em>straight-up</em> constitute a distinct natural class specialized for
  modifying extreme adjectives (such as <em>gigantic</em>,
  <em>fantastic</em>, or <em>gorgeous</em>), and that extreme adjectives
  themselves come in two varieties: ones that encode extremeness as part of
  their lexical semantics and ones that can acquire it on the basis of
  contextual factors. These facts suggest that a theory is required of what
  it means for an adjective to be &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; in the relevant
  sense. I propose one, based on the idea that in any given context, we
  restrict our attention to a particular salient portion of a scale. To
  reflect this, I suggest that quantification over degrees is&mdash;like
  quantification in other domains&mdash;contextually restricted. Extreme
  adjectives and corresponding degree modifiers can thus both be understood
  as a means of signaling that a degree lies outside a contextually-provided
  range.</p>
