      of Adjectives</a></strong>&rsquo;. In Thomas Gamerschlag and Sebastian
      L&ouml;bner (eds.), <em>Cognitive Structures: Linguistic,

      "bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">In certain uses, adjectives appear to make the semantic
      contribution normally associated with adverbs. These readings are often
      thought to be a peripheral phenomenon, restricted to one corner of the
      grammar and just a handful of lexical items. I&rsquo;ll argue that
      it&rsquo;s actually considerably more general than is often recognized,
      and that it admits two fundamentally different modes of explanation: in
      terms of the syntactic machinery that undergirds these structures and
      in terms of the ontology of the objects manipulated by its semantics.
      Both modes of explanation have been suggested for some of the puzzles
      in this domain, and I&rsquo;ll argue both are necessary. With respect
      to adjectives including average and occasional, the key insight is that
      their lexical semantics is fundamentally about kinds. But to arrive at
      a more general theory of adverbial readings, it is also necessary to
      further articulate the compositional semantics. In this spirit,
      I&rsquo;ll argue that these adjectives actually have the semantic type
      of quantificational determiners like every. If this way of thinking
      about adverbial readings is on the right track, it instantiates a means
      by which these two distinct modes of explanation&mdash;and the distinct
      aspects of cognition they may ultimately be associated with&mdash;both
      play a crucial role in bringing about the apparently aberrant behavior
      of this class of adjectives.</p>

      Viruses and Multiple Superlatives</a></strong>&rsquo;. In

      href="bib/morzycki_multsup.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">We don&rsquo;t immediately perceive the interpretation of
      sentences with multiple superlatives as particularly complicated. Their
      most natural reading involves a claim of having struck a balance
      between two different qualities. It&rsquo;s not clear that standard
      accounts of superlatives (such as Szabolsci 1986, Heim 1999, Sharvit
      &amp; Stateva 2002) suffice to deliver quite this reading in a way that
      does it justice and distinguishes it from those of similar sentences we
      perceive as distinct. The other striking property of such sentences is
      that the relevant reading seems brittle and unsteady&mdash;revealingly
      so. This papers considers the possibility that these facts are an
      instance of a broader phenomenon: semantic viruses. Sobin (1994, 1997)
      and Lasnik &amp; Sobin (2000) proposed that certain syntactic processes
      should be regarded as what they called grammatical viruses, rules that
      operate outside the grammar. They suggested that these rules are
      generally complicated, consciously acquired, and awkwardly
      half-internalized. If the syntax can be infected in this way, it stands
      to reason that the semantics might be as well. I argue that it may
      be.</p>

    <p class="abs">Comparatives and equatives are usually assumed to differ
      only in that comparatives require that one degree be greater than
      another, while equatives require that it be at least as great.
      Unexpectedly, though, the interpretation of percentage measure phrases
      differs fundamentally between the constructions. This curious asymmetry
      is, we suggest, revealing. It demonstrates that comparatives and
      equatives are not as similar as one might have thought. We propose an
      analysis of these facts in which the interpretation of percentage
      phrases follows straightforwardly from standard assumptions enriched
      with two additional ones: that percentage phrases denote
      &lsquo;relational degrees&rsquo; (type &lt;d,d&gt;) and that the
      equative morpheme is uninterpreted.</p>

    <p class="abs">Among the more intuitively appealing and elegant ideas in
      the analysis of adjectives is that they denote measure functions
      (Kennedy 1999). But as Bale 2007 pointed out, conjoined adjectives are
      problematic for this view. He, Schwarz 2010, Schwarzschild 2013, and
      have wrestled with the thorny issue of how to conjoin adjectival scales
      in ways that ultimately bear on the nature of degrees. In this talk
      I&rsquo;ll consider how this problem might be approached if degrees are
      understood in terms of kinds, and what that might predict about
      anaphora to conjoined adjectives (e.g. <em>Donald is ignorant and
      unpleasant, and his son even more so</em>).</p>

    <p class="abs">Sobin (1994, 1997) proposed that certain syntactic
      processes should be regarded as what he called grammatical viruses,
      rules that operate outside the grammar and that are the result of a
      prescriptive rule&mdash;consciously acquired, awkwardly
      half-internalized. If the syntax can be infected in this way, it stands
      to reason that the semantics might be as well. I argue here that it may
      be. The potential viruses I&rsquo;ll examine are the word
      <em>respectively</em>, factor/ratio phrases, and certain mathematical
      expressions such as <em>zero</em> (Bylinina &amp; Nouwen 2017). Even in
      the absence of a fully-developed theory of viruses, the benefit of
      recognizing viruses is, first, that doing so may account for empirical
      differences between viruses and the ordinary grammar, and, second, that
      it may simplify the grammar significantly.</p>

    <p class="abs">Adverbial readings of adjectives (as in The occasional
      sailor strolled by) have been a longstanding curiosity, but are often
      thought peripheral and idiosyncratic. This paper argues that such
      nonlocal readings are both more common and more systematic than
      previously recognized. The empirical aim here is to demonstrate that
      despite some real idiosyncrasies, the regularities are sufficient to
      require a unified account. Adjectives that give rise to these readings
      fall into three classes distinguished by the restrictions they impose
      on the quantificational force of their determiner. These restrictions
      and the unexpected wide scope of the adjective can both be explained by
      assuming that the relevant adjectives are quantificational, trigger QR
      from inside the DP, and leave behind a type-shifted trace.</p>

    <p class="abs">This paper argues that a variety of constructions in a
      variety of languages suggest a deep connection between kinds, manners,
      and degrees. We articulate a way of thinking about degrees on which
      this connection is less surprising, rooted in the idea that degrees are
      kinds of Davidsonian states. This enables us to provide a
      cross-categorial compositional semantics for a class of expressions
      that are can serve as anaphors to kinds, manners, and degrees, and can
      introduce clauses that further characterize them. This puts equatives
      in a new light: as a special case of a cross-categorial phenomenon. Our
      analysis of these constructions builds on independently motivated
      assumptions about free relatives and type shifting. This provides
      evidence for a view of degrees on which they are significantly more
      ontologically complex than is standardly assumed.</p>

      href="bib/morzycki_facesofnomdegmod.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ
      from their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of
      variation among them is the means by which a gradable predicate is
      derived from a noun meaning. The empirical starting point is the
      contrast between the degree modifiers <em>real</em>, <em>big</em>, and
      <em>utter</em>, each of which imposes different constraints on what
      nouns it can modify. The <em>real</em> class is relatively
      unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales
      of prototypicality. Size adjectives such as <em>big</em> are less
      flexible: <em>real sportscar</em> has a degree reading but <em>big
      sportscar</em> does not. Degree modifiers such as <em>utter</em> are
      more constrained still: <em>big smoker</em> has a degree reading but
      <em><sup>#</sup>utter smoker</em> is ill-formed. I suggest that both
      <em>big</em> and <em>utter</em> access dimensions of gradability
      lexically provided by the noun, but that <em>utter</em> also imposes
      the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The
      hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a
      typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal
      something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability
      differ.</p>

    <p class="abs">This paper argues that degree modifiers such as
      <em>flat-out</em>, <em>downright</em>, <em>positively</em>, and
      <em>straight-up</em> constitute a distinct natural class specialized
      for modifying extreme adjectives (such as <em>gigantic</em>,
      <em>fantastic</em>, or <em>gorgeous</em>), and that extreme adjectives
      themselves come in two varieties: ones that encode extremeness as part
      of their lexical semantics and ones that can acquire it on the basis of
      contextual factors. These facts suggest that a theory is required of
      what it means for an adjective to be &lsquo;extreme&rsquo; in the
      relevant sense. I propose one, based on the idea that in any given
      context, we restrict our attention to a particular salient portion of a
      scale. To reflect this, I suggest that quantification over degrees
      is&mdash;like quantification in other domains&mdash;contextually
      restricted. Extreme adjectives and corresponding degree modifiers can
      thus both be understood as a means of signaling that a degree lies
      outside a contextually-provided range.</p>

      "bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">This paper offers an analysis of metalinguistic
      comparatives such as <em>more dumb than crazy</em> in which they differ
      from ordinary comparatives in the scale on which they compare: ordinary
      comparatives use scales lexically determined by particular adjectives,
      but metalinguistic ones use a generally available scale of imprecision
      or &lsquo;pragmatic slack&rsquo;. To implement this idea, I propose a
      novel compositional implementation of Lasersohn (1999)&rsquo;s
      pragmatic halos account of imprecision&mdash;one that represents
      clusters of similar meanings as Hamblin alternatives (Hamblin 1973). In
      the theory that results, existential closure over alternatives mediates
      between alternative-sets and meanings in which imprecision has been
      resolved. I then articulate a version of this theory in which the
      alternatives are not related meanings but rather related utterances,
      departing significantly from Lasersohn&rsquo;s original conception.
      Although such a theory of imprecision is more clearly
      &lsquo;metalinguistic&rsquo;, the evidence for it from metalinguistic
      comparatives in English is surprisingly limited. The overall picture
      that emerges is one in which the grammatical distinction between
      ordinary and metalinguistic comparatives tracks the
      independently-motivated distinction between vagueness and
      imprecision.</p>

    <p class="abs">(This is a much elaborated version of <a href=
      "#metaling_NELS">an older paper</a> that appeared in the proceedings of
      NELS&nbsp;38 under the same title. The main difference is that this
      spells out the compositional semantics more explicitly and includes
      more discussion of just how &lsquo;metalinguistic&rsquo; metalinguistic
      comparatives are.)</p>

      are incompatible with expressive modifiers such as <em>goddamn</em>. It
      shows that this otherwise mysterious fact can be explained relatively

    <p class="abs">&lsquo;Metalinguistic&rsquo; comparatives such as <em>more
      dumb than ugly</em> or <em>more a semanticist than a syntactician</em>
      have until recently remained largely unexamined in the formal semantics
      literature (the principal exception is <a href=
      "http://home.uchicago.edu/~giannaki/pubs/final.para.pdf" id=
      "anastasia_paper" >Giannakidou and Stavrou 2007</a>). This paper
      provides an analysis of such structures built on the intuition that
      they compare not along scales introduced by gradable
      adjectives&mdash;as ordinary comparatives do&mdash;but rather along a
      scale of (im)precision, or of how much pragmatic &lsquo;slack&rsquo;
      must be afforded to judge an expression &lsquo;close enough to
      true&rsquo;. This is expressed by reformulating the pragmatic-halos
      theory of imprecision (Lasersohn 1999) in terms of a Hamblin-style
      alternative semantics (Hamblin 1973) in a way that allows degrees of
      imprecision&mdash;roughly, &lsquo;halo size&rsquo;&mdash;to be directly
      compared.</p>

    <p class="abs">Degree readings of size adjectives, as in <em>big
      idiot</em>, cannot be explained as merely a consequence of vagueness or
      as an extra-grammatical phenomenon. Rather, they reflect the
      grammatical architecture of nominal gradability. Such readings are
      available only for size adjectives in attributive positions, and
      systematically only for adjectives that predicate bigness. These
      restrictions can be understood as part of a broader picture of gradable
      NPs in which adnominal degree morphemes&mdash;often overt&mdash;play a
      key role, analogous to their role in AP. Size adjectives acquire degree
      readings through a degree morpheme similar to the one that licenses
      measure phrases in AP. Its syntax gives rise to positional restrictions
      on the availability of these readings, and the semantics of degree
      measurement interacts with the scale structure of size adjectives to
      give rise to restrictions on the adjective itself.</p>

    <p class="abs">Recent work on the semantics of measure phrases has
      grappled with the insight that expressions like <em>six feet
      tall</em>&mdash;often taken to be the prototypical and most
      theoretically revealing cases of MP modification&mdash;are in fact
      unusual, and that differential MPs (as in <em>six feet taller</em>) are
      actually the unmarked case (Schwarzschild 2005 directly, and more
      indirectly Kennedy &amp; Levin (2008) and Svenonius &amp; Kennedy
      2006). This talk provides further evidence for this view, primarily
      from the grammar of <em>by</em> MPs across categories, and proposes a
      way of drawing a sortal distinction between differential degrees and
      ordinary ones in which differential MP modification emerges as
      grammatically simpler than its non-differential counterpart.</p>

    <p class="abs">The systematic but often subtle semantic differences
      between prenominal and postnominal adjectives noted by Bolinger (1967)
      and others in many respects remain poorly understood. A similar
      murkiness surrounds many of the differences between preverbal and
      postverbal adverbs. This paper examines an intriguing parallel between
      these domains: in English, a nonrestrictive interpretation is possible
      without parenthetical intonation for prenominal adjectives and
      preverbal adverbs, but not for postnominal adjectives and postverbal
      adverbs. This effect is derived here by exploring a possibility made
      available by the two-dimensional semantics proposed for nonrestrictive
      modification by Potts (2003): that different dimensions of meaning
      might observe fundamentally different rules with respect to the
      syntax-semantics mapping. Through a proposed structural asymmetry in
      the semantic mechanism that drives nonrestrictive interpretation, a
      cross-categorial account is developed of why nonparenthetical
      nonrestrictives occupy the positions that they do, and of how they can
      receive the proper interpretation in those positions.</p>

    <p class="abs">This paper relates two issues normally considered
      separately: the licensing conditions on AP- and PP-modifying measure
      phrases (such as <em>six feet</em> in <em>six feet above the barn</em>)
      and the atelicity restriction imposed by certain temporal adverbials.
      These questions are given a common answer: both classes of expressions
      are subject to an independently-motivated cross-categorial monotonicity
      condition on measure-phrase modification, the Modification Condition
      (Zwarts and Winter 2000, Winter 2001, 2004) of Vector Space Semantics.
      To make this connection, the vector space approach is extended to
      temporal semantics and independent evidence is marshaled for
      assimilating some temporal adverbials to measure phrases. I also pursue
      a cross-categorial syntax and semantics for measure-phrase modification
      that may blunt certain arguments in favor of the ontological
      enrichments advocated in Vector Space Semantics.</p>

    <p class="abs">Although the traditional focus of research into degree
      modification has been the adjectival extended projection, it has long
      been recognized that degree modification or something quite like it is
      possible in other categories as well. The conditions under which it is
      possible, though, and mechanisms that bring it about remain largely
      mysterious. This paper examines one peculiar species of such
      modification, exemplified by <em>that enormous idiot</em> or <em>a big
      beer-drinker</em>, in which a size adjective characterizes a degree
      associated with the modified noun. Across a number of languages, these
      readings manifest two intriguing properties: they are possible
      prenominally but not postnominally, and systematically with adjectives
      that predicate bigness but not with ones that predicate smallness. In
      the compositional semantics ultimately proposed here, these
      generalizations follow from a restriction on how degrees on one scale
      can be mapped to degrees on another and from an independently-motivated
      close syntactic parallel between the nominal and adjectival extended
      projections.</p>

      below. <a href="bib/morzycki_04b.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">This paper seeks to establish that measure phrases in the
      extended AP and PP&mdash;such as <em>six feet tall</em> and <em>twenty
      minutes before midnight</em>&mdash;have a direct counterpart in the
      verbal domain. These verbal measure phrases, exemplified in English in
      e.g. <em>He slept several hours</em>, constitute a natural class
      distinct from other DP adverbials and characterized by obligatorily
      narrow scope, low structural position, an Aktionsart-related
      presupposition, and quantificationally weak interpretations. This
      constellation of characteristics is shown to follow naturally from the
      view that these expressions mirror core syntactic and semantic
      properties of AP and PP measure phrases. In particular, it will be
      argued here that these expressions have a syntax that places them in
      the specifier of a functional projection, just as has long been assumed
      for AP/PP measure phrases and as has been proposed in a different and
      independent line of research for adverbials more generally; and that
      they have a semantics in which they are interpreted as arguments of the
      head of this licensing projection, and therefore scopally and
      distributionally constrained and implicated in the aspectual semantics
      of the clause. Aktionsart information which cannot plausibly come from
      the DP itself is thereby attributed instead to a verbal feature
      responsible for licensing the adverbial. Independent evidence for this
      approach is adduced from true adverbs and parallels with proposals made
      in the analysis of accusative adverbials in Slavic and in Finnish.</p>

      href="bib/morzycki_04.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">Among the principal problems in the syntax and semantics
      of adverbial modification is how the position and interpretation of
      adverbs should be related. Efforts toward addressing aspects of this
      question (from Jackendoff 1972 and McConnell-Ginet 1984 to Cinque 1999
      and Ernst 2002) have focused primarily on adverbial modification in the
      verbal and sentential domain. There are, however, less prototypical
      uses of adverbs in the adjectival extended projection as well, and
      interestingly, the interpretation adverbs receive there varies
      predictably from the one they receive elsewhere. In this respect,
      adverbial modification in AP offers another perspective on the larger
      problem. This paper addresses the syntax and semantics of certain such
      &lsquo;ad-adjectival&rsquo; adverbs, presenting an analysis of how
      their interpretation arises and of how it relates to the interpretation
      of their counterparts outside the adjectival domain. Along the way, it
      touches on broader questions about how degree semantics relates to
      event(uality) semantics, and about how the structure of the extended AP
      relates to that of the extended VP with respect to adverb
      licensing.</p>

    <p class="abs">One of the obstacles to identifying the syntactic notion
      of interpretability (as applied to e.g. interpretable features) with
      the formal-semantic notion is that there is no agreed-upon way of
      assigning a denotation to bundles of more than one interpretable
      feature. This paper explores one means of doing so&mdash;loosening the
      type-theoretical demands a bit by extending the idea that function
      composition is available in the morphology (which is not new) to
      feature bundles, though in a modified form. The advantage of this is
      that a single denotation can be given to an interpretable feature
      irrespective of whether it occupies its own node or is bundled with
      others, thereby making possible more representationally conservative
      phrase structures where desirable without precluding more articulated
      ones where necessary. The proposal is developed and motivated in the
      empirical context of otherwise mysterious constraints on the relative
      order in English of classificatory adjectives, color adjectives, and
      attributive nouns of a particular sort.</p>

    <p class="abs">In English, expressions introduced by
      <em>such</em>&mdash;as in <em>such a dog</em>&mdash;can be taken to
      involve instantiations of a contextually-provided kind (in the sense of
      Carlson 1977). Such an understanding is quite natural in part because
      it is well-established that reference to kinds is possible in the
      nominal domain. Surprisingly, though, in Polish the analogue of English
      such&mdash;<em>taki</em>, as in <em>taki pies</em> (lit.
      &lsquo;such-<span class="sc">masc</span> dog&rsquo;)&mdash;also occurs
      in its bare form in the verbal domain, as <em>tak</em> in e.g.
      <em>ta&#324;czy&#263; tak</em> (lit. &lsquo;dance-<span class=
      "sc">inf</span> such&rsquo;; &lsquo;dance that way&rsquo;). It is
      possible to extend the kind-reference analysis of adnominal
      <em>taki</em> to its adverbial counterpart by exploiting the
      parallelism between individuals and Davidsonian events. But this quite
      straightforward path leads to an understanding of adverbial
      <em>tak</em> in terms of a less familiar and perhaps unexpected notion:
      reference to kinds of events. This paper formulates an analysis framed
      in these terms and explores its consequences for the semantics of
      manner.</p>

    <p class="abs">It is a natural and common assumption that adjectives such
      as <em>whole</em> and <em>entire</em> involve universal quantification
      over parts of an individual. This paper argues that in a sense exactly
      the opposite is true: that DPs containing <em>whole</em> and
      <em>entire</em> are obligatorily non-quantificational expressions. An
      account is developed in which these adjectives are instead maximizing
      modifiers in the sense of Brisson (1998). This approach leads to
      explanations of their scopal and discourse-anaphoric properties, as
      well as of the determiner restrictions they impose and of how they
      differ from e.g. <em>complete</em>. In implementing this, the notion of
      covers (Schwarzschild 1996) is imported in a somewhat modified form
      from the semantics of plurals into the semantics of singular
      individuals. Along the way, evidence emerges for a particular
      conception of choice-function indefinites (Winter 1997, Reinhart 1997,
      Kratzer 1998, Matthewson 1999).</p>
