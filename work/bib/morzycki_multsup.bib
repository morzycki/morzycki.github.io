    abstract = {We don't immediately perceive the interpretation of sentences with multiple superlatives as particularly complicated. Their most natural reading involves a claim of having struck a balance between two different qualities. It's not clear that standard accounts of superlatives (such as Szabolsci 1986, Heim 1999, Sharvit & Stateva 2002) suffice to deliver quite this reading in a way that does it justice and distinguishes it from those of similar sentences we perceive as distinct. The other striking property of such sentences is that the relevant reading seems brittle and unsteady---revealingly so. This papers considers the possibility that these facts are an instance of a broader phenomenon: semantic viruses. Sobin (1994, 1997) and Lasnik & Sobin (2000) proposed that certain syntactic processes should be regarded as what they called grammatical viruses, rules that operate outside the grammar. They suggested that these rules are generally complicated, consciously acquired, and awkwardly half-internalized. If the syntax can be infected in this way, it stands to reason that the semantics might be as well. I argue that it may be.}
