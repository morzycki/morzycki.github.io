<p>Morzycki, Marcin. 2013. <strong><a href=

  >&lsquo;The Lexical Semantics of Adjectives: More Than Just
  Scales&rsquo;</a></strong>. This is a chapter of an in-preparation book to
  be called <em>Modification</em> (in the Cambridge University Press series
  <em>Key Topics in Semantics an Pragmatics</em>). The book is something
  between a textbook for people with a basic background in semantics and an
  introductory survey of work on the semantics of modification. <a href=
  "http://msu.edu/~morzycki/work/book" id="book_site" >More information about
  the whole project and additional chapters</a> are also available. I&rsquo;d
  really appreciate any feedback on this. <a class="bib" href=
