	Thoroughly revised 1-Mar-10. ---MJM

   Using pixels rather than ems or percentages here deliberately. This seems
   to be the only thing that allows scaling properly (weirdly). Using ems
   entails having them change size when you change the font size within a
   single page, which wreaks all manner of havoc. So don't change this unless
   really, really sure.

         - The body needs to provide a background color. This could be done

      /* This is the main text inside the content div (i.e., inside the main 
      vertical space). It's distinct in that it only goes as far as the text 
      itself goes. Distinguishing these is useful because: 

         - This means that this can have padding after it, which makes things
           look a lot better when scrolled all the way to the bottom---the
           text doesn't abut the edge of the window. Adding this padding to
           the content itself would mean that when the text doesn't overflow
           the window, the content---which necessarily extends all the way to
           the bottom of it---would still have more padding below the bottom
           of the window. This results in a gratuitous spillover beyond the
           window and a pointless scrollbar.

         - If I wanted the footer to be aligned with either the bottom
           of the text or the bottom of the window, whichever is longer, this
           would make it possible by aligning with the bottom of the content
           (i.e., putting it inside the content div but outside the text div).
           Because this text div itself has padding below it, it ensures that
           the content will as well, which in turn means that something
           aligned with the bottom of the content div wouldn't overlap with
           what's inside it when it extends beyond the window.

      long enough.) This has to be done here rather than in the content div
      because the content div is 100% high, so adding it there would make it

      - At one point, I had this work by having the hovered-over item
        shrink the size of its padding to accommodate its wider borders to
        prevent subsequent menu items from being displaced. This turns out
        not to scale up when font size is changed, at least in Firefox.
        
      - Then I tried drawing the rules using a background image rather
        than a border. This is more reliable because it never affects the
        vertical position of the text itself---but on Firefox, at least on
        the laptop, this causes the rules to actually disappear when
        resized, and, worse, only some of the rules disappear, so that
        looks like crap.
        
      - The most recent arrangement (like the immediately preceding one)
        draws the thicker hovered-over rules for all items in advance, but
        transparently, which is a safer way of ensuring that precisely
        enough white space is present and there is no popping up and down
        of the menu items below the selection. But now instead of a
        background image, the rules are drawn using borders again, but on
        li rather than on a. (Previously didn't do this because was using a
        background image for the hand, which would cause any rules to
        include it. Now that I'm using an absolutely-positioned thing, this
        isn't a problem.)
