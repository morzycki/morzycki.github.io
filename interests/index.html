<p>Semantics, syntax, and their interface.</p>

<h4 id="in_slightly_more_than">In slightly more than five words</h4>

<p>Most of my work centers on various aspects of the grammar of modification.
  It&rsquo;s not at all obvious that this actually constitutes a natural
  class of phenomena, but whether it does so is an interesting question in
  itself. One issue I have been thinking about in the last few years is how
  gradability works in non-adjectival syntactic contexts. I&rsquo;ve also
  been working on degree modifiers, including both the more familiar sort
  found in the extended AP and what I believe to be their analogues
  elsewhere. Other topics I have worked on less recently include
  nonrestrictive modification, measure phrases, modification of quantifiers,
  adverbial modification, expressive meaning, and apparently semantic
  restrictions on modifier order. Much of my work also reflects a fondness
  for phenomena that might be regarded as peripheral but turn out to be
  productive and, in the ideal case, to bear on more general theoretical
  questions.</p>

<h4 id="for_non_linguist_humans">For non-linguist humans</h4>

<p>What theoretical linguists in general do is try to figure out what exactly
  it is you know when you know a language. One aspect of this is knowledge of
  meaning. That&rsquo;s what I work on. I usually think about how the
  meanings of sentences are assembled from the meanings of words, and what
  this tells us about the meanings of the words themselves. I seem to have
  fixated on various puzzles involving modifiers&mdash;bits of a sentence
  that, in general, can be left out without making the sentence sound
  strange. That&rsquo;s a broad topical focus, but there is also an
  intellectual aesthetic running through a lot of my work: I really like
  linguistic phenomena that might superficially seem minor or idiosyncratic
  but that nevertheless turn out to be systematic and (hopefully) shed light
  on larger theoretical issues.</p>

<h4 id="but_never_mind_this">But never mind this&hellip;</h4>

<p>Really, in order to get a sense of what I do, you should just look at <a
  href="../work">my work</a> instead.</p>
