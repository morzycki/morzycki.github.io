    abstract = {We provide a semantics for the adjective single and ultimately related expressions. Single manifests a curious pattern of interpretations that, we argue, sheds light on how adjectives get nonlocal readings, exhaustivity effects, and the semantics of groups. More precisely, we will argue that on its most salient reading single is, like occasional, a nonlocal adjective in the sense of Schwarz (2006, ta) and others, receiving sentential scope. Its core lexical semantics includes an exhaustivity component that generates an ‘exactly’ interpretation in general and an ‘even’-like one in downward entailing contexts. Another ingredient of its meaning makes use of groups (in the sense of Barker 1992, Landman 1989) in an unusual way: via one-membered singleton groups, which give rise not to collective predication, but a pragmatic structuring the domain of individuals in a given context. Additionally, single has a distinct meaning that is part of the same paradigm as double and triple, with its own distribution. While we assign this meaning a separate denotation, it similarly structures the sub-atomic domain relative to a given context.}
