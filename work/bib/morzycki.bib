    abstract = {Francez and Koontz-Garboden (2017) propose that in many languages, gradable predication is fundamentally about not degrees but qualities qua portions of an abstract substance, like wisdom or beauty, that an individual can be said to possess. Both notions—qualities and degrees—are crucial, we propose, to understanding an important distinction between two varieties of degree nominalization in English (e.g. height in Ingo is Bertha’s height vs tallness in Ingo has Bertha’s tallness). Building on Bochnak (2013) and Gobeski (2019), we marshal a range of unnoticed or under-noticed contrasts that we argue show that some nominalizations denote qualities and others denote what we’ll call degree concepts, which are intensionalized degrees.},

    abstract = {Ktunaxa---a language isolate spoken in parts of British Columbia and Montana---asks questions about manners, locations, and times using two distinct grammatical elements in different positions: a wh particle that is structurally high and signals that a modifier question is being asked and a preverb that is low and signals the type of the modifier question (the ‘descriptive content marker’, or DCM). DCMs have an independent distribution as anaphors for properties of events. In questions, the wh particle binds this variable and yields an alternative set. Ktunaxa’s two-part strategy for expressing modifier questions---one word dedicated to forming the question and one word dedicated to defining the question type---puts a new spin on the Japanese-style architecture of wh questions, with the second element an anaphor rather than an indefinite. That sheds light on the building blocks of questions more broadly.},

The aim of this talk is in part to bring crosslinguistic evidence to bear on this idea, exploring the grammar of zero in Cantonese and in Ktunaxa, an endangered languages spoken in parts of Canada and the US. Intriguingly, Ktunaxa expresses zero with a predicate of absence (roughly, 'that which is absent'). This will lead us to reflect on predicating absence more generally as a species of negative existential.},

On the object reading, these nouns are count, but on the eventive reading, they are necessarily semantically mass. These readings are also possible under a wide variety of determiners. They can even be expressed with bare singular DP arguments, which are of course not generally possible in English. We treat these uses as the result of a semantic shift that approximates the the effects of gerundive nominalization: for example, it may map piano to something like ’piano playing’. Building on previous work Greeson et al. (to appear), we demonstrate that these assumptions—along with typical assumptions about kind reference and event kinds—make possible an explanation of the curious behavior of definite descriptions and bare singulars with play (e.g. 'play (the) piano'). That includes finer-grained facts about kind reference, event kinds, adverbial readings of adjectives, and classificatory/relational adjectives (i.e. subkind modifiers).},

These differences can be related to restrictions on what sort of objects different MPs can measure. They can be captured by enriching the theoretical notion of degrees with tropes (as advocated in a line of work by Friederike Moltmann). Some MPs, such as sports scores, require taking a further step: embracing tuples of degrees as a sort of degree. We classify composite MPs into three varieties, provide diagnostics for each of them. The inquiry has ramifications for broader questions about the relationship between the facts of the world and how they are encoded in language.},

Our focus is an additional tool that is perhaps more theoretically surprising: bare singulars that characterize musical instruments. These occur notably as arguments of verbs like 'play' and 'learn', but also in argument positions more widely. This puzzle can be understood, we suggest, if these bare singulars are taken to be, essentially, mass terms for Carlsonian kinds of events. This interacts with independent properties of definite descriptions, adjectival modification, and a light-verb form of play to yield an intricate constellation of effects, including restrictions on the availability of adverbial readings of adjectives (Stump 1985, Larson 1999, Gehrke & McNally 2015, and many others).}

We examine `zero' in Cantonese, where it provides evidence that such null individuals are a matter of crosslinguistic variation. Cantonese zero has a more restricted distribution. It occurs widely in a number of contexts, but it is systematically ruled out with ordinary classifiers. These facts, coupled with assumptions about the nature of measurement and nominal semantics, demonstrate despite its extensive use in the language, zero is impossible in precisely the uses that require null individuals. Cantonese seems to be telling us that such null individuals are simply absent from its ontology, implying an interesting difference in natural language metaphysics between the languages---and perhaps a different perspective on what theoretical shape crosslinguistic variation can take.},

    abstract = {We provide a semantics for the adjective single and ultimately related expressions. Single manifests a curious pattern of interpretations that, we argue, sheds light on how adjectives get nonlocal readings, exhaustivity effects, and the semantics of groups. More precisely, we will argue that on its most salient reading single is, like occasional, a nonlocal adjective in the sense of Schwarz (2006, ta) and others, receiving sentential scope. Its core lexical semantics includes an exhaustivity component that generates an ‘exactly’ interpretation in general and an ‘even’-like one in downward entailing contexts. Another ingredient of its meaning makes use of groups (in the sense of Barker 1992, Landman 1989) in an unusual way: via one-membered singleton groups, which give rise not to collective predication, but a pragmatic structuring the domain of individuals in a given context. Additionally, single has a distinct meaning that is part of the same paradigm as double and triple, with its own distribution. While we assign this meaning a separate denotation, it similarly structures the sub-atomic domain relative to a given context.}

This entails a discussion of how gradability and vagueness are related, and of how best to model that relation semantically. Perhaps the most informative window into this domain is the class of degree constructions -- which includes comparatives, equatives, superlatives, and their less‐well‐understood grammatical cousins. These provide a view of how adjectives fit into larger structures, but it's possible to look in the other direction as well, by using a variety of degree morphemes (such as very and fully) to explore subtle distinctions in the lexical semantics of adjectives themselves. Finally, over the last decade or so, major strides have been made toward answering a central question: how do languages differ in how they express gradation and comparison?},

    title = {Semantic Viruses and Multiple Superlatives},
    year = {2020},
    abstract = {We don't immediately perceive the interpretation of sentences with multiple superlatives as particularly complicated. Their most natural reading involves a claim of having struck a balance between two different qualities. It's not clear that standard accounts of superlatives (such as Szabolsci 1986, Heim 1999, Sharvit & Stateva 2002) suffice to deliver quite this reading in a way that does it justice and distinguishes it from those of similar sentences we perceive as distinct. The other striking property of such sentences is that the relevant reading seems brittle and unsteady---revealingly so. This papers considers the possibility that these facts are an instance of a broader phenomenon: semantic viruses. Sobin (1994, 1997) and Lasnik & Sobin (2000) proposed that certain syntactic processes should be regarded as what they called grammatical viruses, rules that operate outside the grammar. They suggested that these rules are generally complicated, consciously acquired, and awkwardly half-internalized. If the syntax can be infected in this way, it stands to reason that the semantics might be as well. I argue that it may be.}

The empirical aim here is to demonstrate that despite some real idiosyncrasies, the regularities are sufficient to require a unified account. Adjectives that give rise to these readings fall into three classes distinguished by the restrictions they impose on the quantificational force of their determiner. These restrictions and the unexpected wide scope of the adjective can both be explained by assuming that the relevant adjectives are quantificational, trigger QR from inside the DP, and leave behind a type-shifted trace.}

This enables us to provide a cross-categorial compositional semantics for a class of expressions that can serve as anaphors to kinds, manners, and degrees, or introduce clauses that further characterize them. A consequence of this is that equatives emerge as a special case of a more general cross-categorial phenomenon.

The empirical starting point is the contrast between the degree modifiers \emph{real}, \emph{big}, and \emph{utter}, each of which imposes different constraints on what nouns it can modify. The \emph{real} class is relatively unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales of prototypicality. Size adjectives such as \emph{big} are less flexible: \emph{real sportscar} has a degree reading but \emph{big sportscar} does not. Degree modifiers such as \emph{utter} are more constrained still: \emph{big smoker} has a degree reading but \emph{\#utter smoker} is ill-formed. I suggest that both \emph{big} and \emph{utter} access dimensions of gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that \emph{utter} also imposes the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability differ.}

These facts suggest that a theory is required of adjectival 'extremeness' itself. I propose one, based on the idea that in any given context, we restrict our attention to a particular salient portion of a scale. To reflect this, I suggest that quantification over degrees is---like quantification in other domains---contextually restricted. Extreme adjectives and corresponding degree modifiers can thus both be understood as a means of signaling that a degree lies outside a contextually-provided range.}

To implement this idea, I propose a novel compositional implementation of Lasersohn (1999)'s pragmatic halos account of imprecision-one that represents clusters of similar meanings as Hamblin alternatives (Hamblin 1973). In the theory that results, existential closure over alternatives mediates between alternative-sets and meanings in which imprecision has been resolved. I then articulate a version of this theory in which the alternatives are not related meanings but rather related utterances, departing significantly from Lasersohn's original conception. Although such a theory of imprecision is more clearly 'metalinguistic', the evidence for it from metalinguistic comparatives in English is surprisingly limited. The overall picture that emerges is one in which the grammatical distinction between ordinary and metalinguistic comparatives tracks the independently-motivated distinction between vagueness and imprecision.}

This paper provides an analysis of such structures built on the intuition that they compare not along scales introduced by gradable adjectives---as ordinary comparatives do---but rather along a scale of (im)precision, or of how much pragmatic `slack' must be afforded to judge an expression `close enough to true'. This is expressed by reformulating the pragmatic-halos theory of imprecision (Lasersohn 1999) in terms of a Hamblin-style alternative semantics (Hamblin 1973) in a way that allows degrees of imprecision---roughly, `halo size'---to be directly compared.},

Rather, they reflect the grammatical architecture of nominal gradability. Such readings are available only for size adjectives in attributive positions, and systematically only for adjectives that predicate bigness. These restrictions can be understood as part of a broader picture of gradable NPs in which adnominal degree morphemes---often overt---play a key role, analogous to their role in AP. Size adjectives acquire degree readings through a degree morpheme similar to the one that licenses measure phrases in AP. Its syntax gives rise to positional restrictions on the availability of these readings, and the semantics of degree measurement interacts with the scale structure of size adjectives to give rise to restrictions on the adjective itself.}

This talk provides further evidence for this view, primarily from the grammar of \emph{by} MPs across categories, and proposes a way of drawing a sortal distinction between differential degrees and ordinary ones in which differential MP modification emerges as grammatically simpler than its non-differential counterpart.}

A similar murkiness surrounds many of the differences between preverbal and postverbal adverbs. This paper examines an intriguing parallel between these domains: in English, a nonrestrictive interpretation is possible without parenthetical intonation for prenominal adjectives and preverbal adverbs, but not for postnominal adjectives and postverbal adverbs. This effect is derived here by exploring a possibility made available by the two-dimensional semantics proposed for nonrestrictive modification by Potts (2003): that different dimensions of meaning might observe fundamentally different rules with respect to the syntax-semantics mapping. Through a proposed structural asymmetry in the semantic mechanism that drives nonrestrictive interpretation, a cross-categorial account is developed of why nonparenthetical nonrestrictives occupy the positions that they do, and of how they can receive the proper interpretation in those positions.}

    abstract = {Among the principal problems in the syntax and semantics of adverbial modification is how the position and interpretation of adverbs should be related. Efforts toward addressing aspects of this question (from Jackendoff 1972 and McConnell-Ginet 1984 to Cinque 1999 and Ernst 2002) have focused primarily on adverbial modification in the verbal and sentential domain. There are, however, less prototypical uses of adverbs in the adjectival extended projection as well, and interestingly, the interpretation adverbs receive there varies predictably from the one they receive elsewhere. In this respect, adverbial modification in AP offers another perspective on the larger problem. This paper addresses the syntax and semantics of certain such `ad-adjectival' adverbs, presenting an analysis of how their interpretation arises and of how it relates to the interpretation of their counterparts outside the adjectival domain. Along the way, it touches on broader questions about how degree semantics relates to event(uality) semantics, and about how the structure of the extended AP relates to that of the extended VP with respect to adverb licensing. }

This paper explores one means of doing so---loosening the type-theoretical demands a bit by extending the idea that function composition is available in the morphology (which is not new) to feature bundles, though in a modified form. The advantage of this is that a single denotation can be given to an interpretable feature irrespective of whether it occupies its own node or is bundled with others, thereby making possible more representationally conservative phrase structures where desirable without precluding more articulated ones where necessary. The proposal is developed and motivated in the empirical context of otherwise mysterious constraints on the relative order in English of classificatory adjectives, color adjectives, and attributive nouns of a particular sort.}

Such an understanding is quite natural in part because it is well-established that reference to kinds is possible in the nominal domain. Surprisingly, though, in Polish the analogue of English such---\emph{taki}, as in \emph{taki pies} (lit. `such-\textsc{masc} dog')---also occurs in its bare form in the verbal domain, as \emph{tak} in e.g. \emph{ta\'nczy\'c} (lit. `dance-\textsc{inf} such'; `dance that way'). It is possible to extend the kind-reference analysis of adnominal \emph{taki} to its adverbial counterpart by exploiting the parallelism between individuals and Davidsonian events. But this quite straightforward path leads to an understanding of adverbial \emph{tak} in terms of a less familiar and perhaps unexpected notion: reference to kinds of events. This paper formulates an analysis framed in these terms and explores its consequences for the semantics of manner.}

An account is developed in which these adjectives are instead maximizing modifiers in the sense of Brisson (1998). This approach leads to explanations of their scopal and discourse-anaphoric properties, as well as of the determiner restrictions they impose and of how they differ from e.g. \emph{complete}. In implementing this, the notion of covers (Schwarzschild 1996) is imported in a somewhat modified form from the semantics of plurals into the semantics of singular individuals. Along the way, evidence emerges for a particular conception of choice-function indefinites (Winter 1997, Reinhart 1997, Kratzer 1998, Matthewson 1999).}
