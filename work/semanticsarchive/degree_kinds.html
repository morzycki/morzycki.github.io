  <meta name="abstract" content="This paper argues that a variety of
    constructions from a variety of languages suggest a deep connection
    between Carlsonian kinds, manners, and degrees. We articulate a way of
    thinking about degrees on which this connection is less surprising,
    rooted in the idea that degrees are Carlsonian kinds of Davidsonian
    states. This enables us to provide a cross-categorial compositional
    semantics for a class of expressions that are can serve as anaphors to
    kinds, manners, and degrees, and can introduce clauses that further
    characterize them. This puts equatives in a new light: as a special case
    of a cross-categorial phenomenon. Our analysis of these constructions
    builds on independently motivated assumptions about free relatives and
    type shifting. This provides evidence for a view of degrees on which they
    are significantly more ontologically complex than is standardly assumed."
