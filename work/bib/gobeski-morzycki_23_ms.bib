    abstract = {Purely numerical measure phrases (MPs) that lack a unit term---such as 'three' or 'two thirds'---are normally treated as denoting degrees on a single shared numerical scale. This paper examines an apparently unrecognized class of complex purely numerical MPs including 'two in three' and 'six to one', which we term 'composite MPs' because they have other MPs as subconstituents. They demonstrate, we argue, that mathematically equivalent MPs arenâ€™t equivalent in their distribution and in their semantics. These differences can be related to restrictions on what sort of objects different MPs can measure. They can be captured by enriching the theoretical notion of degrees with tropes (as advocated in a line of work by Friederike Moltmann). Some MPs, such as sports scores, require taking a further step: embracing tuples of degrees as a sort of degree. We classify composite MPs into three varieties, provide diagnostics for each of them. The inquiry has ramifications for broader questions about the relationship between the facts of the world and how they are encoded in language.},
