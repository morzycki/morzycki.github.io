    abstract = {Across a number of languages, there are suspicious cross-categorial correspondences among expressions used to talk about degrees, manners, and kinds. The principal aim of this talk is to develop an understanding of the ontology of degrees that would make such connections less surprising. It is of course standard to assume that adjectives have a degree argument. It is less typical but nevertheless natural to assume that adjectives have a state argument. These are very rarely discussed simultaneously. Yet taken together, these assumptions suggest that adjectives must actually have both degree and state arguments. This rather unappealing conclusion is not inevitable, however. States are complex objects that, inescapably, must encode more information than degrees as they are ordinarily construed. Perhaps, then, they alone can suffice. To pursue this possibility, it will be necessary to reconceptualize degrees in terms of states. Building on the idea that manners can be understood as Carlsonian kinds of events (Landman & Morzycki 2003, Landman 2006), I will explore the possibility that degrees can be understood as Carlsonian kinds of states. Together, these ideas constitute a synthesis on which the correspondences between degrees, manners, and kinds are expected.},
