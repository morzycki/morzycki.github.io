    abstract = {This paper argues that degree modifiers such as \emph{flat-out}, \emph{downright}, \emph{positively}, and \emph{straight-up} constitute a distinct natural class specialized for modifying extreme adjectives (such as \emph{gigantic}, \emph{fantastic}, or \emph{gorgeous}), and that extreme adjectives themselves come in two varieties: ones that encode extremeness as part of their lexical meaning and ones that can acquire it on the basis of contextual factors. These facts suggest that a theory is required of adjectival 'extremeness' itself. I propose one, based on the idea that in any given context, we restrict our attention to a particular salient portion of a scale. To reflect this, I suggest that quantification over degrees is---like quantification in other domains---contextually restricted. Extreme adjectives and corresponding degree modifiers can thus both be understood as a means of signaling that a degree lies outside a contextually-provided range.}
