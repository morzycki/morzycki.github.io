    abstract = {This squib examines the grammar of \emph{galore}, arguing that it is a quantificational determiner that operates exclusively on kinds. In doing so it realizes a possible determiner denotation that one might independently expect to occur in English in the crosslinguistic framework proposed in Chierchia (1998).},
