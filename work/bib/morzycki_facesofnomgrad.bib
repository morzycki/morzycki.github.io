    abstract = {This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ from their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of variation among them is the means by which a gradable predicate is derived from a noun meaning. The empirical starting point is the contrast between the degree modifiers \emph{real}, \emph{big}, and \emph{utter}, each of which imposes different constraints on what nouns it can modify. The \emph{real} class is relatively unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales of prototypicality. Size adjectives such as \emph{big} are less flexible: \emph{real sportscar} has a degree reading but \emph{big sportscar} does not. Degree modifiers such as \emph{utter} are more constrained still: \emph{big smoker} has a degree reading but \emph{\#utter smoker} is ill-formed. I suggest that both \emph{big} and \emph{utter} access dimensions of gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that \emph{utter} also imposes the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability differ.}
