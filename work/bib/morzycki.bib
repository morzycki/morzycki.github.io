    abstract = {This paper argues that a variety of constructions in a variety of languages suggest a deep connection between kinds, manners, and degrees. We articulate a way of thinking about degrees on which this connection is less surprising, rooted in the idea that degrees are kinds of Davidsonian states. This enables us to provide a cross-categorial compositional semantics for a class of expressions that can serve as anaphors to kinds, manners, and degrees, or introduce clauses that further characterize them. A consequence of this is that equatives emerge as a special case of a more general cross-categorial phenomenon. The analysis is undergirded by independently motivated assumptions about free relatives and type shifting. It provides evidence for a view of degrees on which they are significantly more ontologically complex than is typically thought.},

    abstract = {This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ from their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of variation among them is the means by which a gradable predicate is derived from a noun meaning. The empirical starting point is the contrast between the degree modifiers \emph{real}, \emph{big}, and \emph{utter}, each of which imposes different constraints on what nouns it can modify. The \emph{real} class is relatively unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales of prototypicality. Size adjectives such as \emph{big} are less flexible: \emph{real sportscar} has a degree reading but \emph{big sportscar} does not. Degree modifiers such as \emph{utter} are more constrained still: \emph{big smoker} has a degree reading but \emph{\#utter smoker} is ill-formed. I suggest that both \emph{big} and \emph{utter} access dimensions of gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that \emph{utter} also imposes the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability differ.}

These facts suggest that a theory is required of adjectival 'extremeness' itself. I propose one, based on the idea that in any given context, we restrict our attention to a particular salient portion of a scale. To reflect this, I suggest that quantification over degrees is---like quantification in other domains---contextually restricted. Extreme adjectives and corresponding degree modifiers can thus both be understood as a means of signaling that a degree lies outside a contextually-provided range.}

    abstract = {This paper offers an analysis of metalinguistic comparatives such as \emph{more dumb than crazy} in which they differ from ordinary comparatives in the scale on which they compare: ordinary comparatives use scales lexically determined by particular adjectives, but metalinguistic ones use a generally available scale of imprecision or `pragmatic slack'. To implement this idea, I propose a novel compositional implementation of Lasersohn (1999)'s pragmatic halos account of imprecision-one that represents clusters of similar meanings as Hamblin alternatives (Hamblin 1973). In the theory that results, existential closure over alternatives mediates between alternative-sets and meanings in which imprecision has been resolved. I then articulate a version of this theory in which the alternatives are not related meanings but rather related utterances, departing significantly from Lasersohn's original conception. Although such a theory of imprecision is more clearly 'metalinguistic', the evidence for it from metalinguistic comparatives in English is surprisingly limited. The overall picture that emerges is one in which the grammatical distinction between ordinary and metalinguistic comparatives tracks the independently-motivated distinction between vagueness and imprecision.}

This is expressed by reformulating the pragmatic-halos theory of imprecision (Lasersohn 1999) in terms of a Hamblin-style alternative semantics (Hamblin 1973) in a way that allows degrees of imprecision---roughly, `halo size'---to be directly compared.},

    abstract = {Degree readings of size adjectives, as in \emph{big idiot}, cannot be explained as merely a consequence of vagueness or as an extra-grammatical phenomenon. Rather, they reflect the grammatical architecture of nominal gradability. Such readings are available only for size adjectives in attributive positions, and systematically only for adjectives that predicate bigness. These restrictions can be understood as part of a broader picture of gradable NPs in which adnominal degree morphemes---often overt---play a key role, analogous to their role in AP. Size adjectives acquire degree readings through a degree morpheme similar to the one that licenses measure phrases in AP. Its syntax gives rise to positional restrictions on the availability of these readings, and the semantics of degree measurement interacts with the scale structure of size adjectives to give rise to restrictions on the adjective itself.}

    abstract = {Recent work on the semantics of measure phrases has grappled with the insight that expressions like \emph{six feet tall}---often taken to be the prototypical and most theoretically revealing cases of MP modification---are in fact unusual, and that differential MPs (as in \emph{six feet taller}) are actually the unmarked case (Schwarzschild 2005 directly, and more indirectly Kennedy \& Levin (2008) and Svenonius \& Kennedy 2006). This talk provides further evidence for this view, primarily from the grammar of \emph{by} MPs across categories, and proposes a way of drawing a sortal distinction between differential degrees and ordinary ones in which differential MP modification emerges as grammatically simpler than its non-differential counterpart.}

A similar murkiness surrounds many of the differences between preverbal and postverbal adverbs. This paper examines an intriguing parallel between these domains: in English, a nonrestrictive interpretation is possible without parenthetical intonation for prenominal adjectives and preverbal adverbs, but not for postnominal adjectives and postverbal adverbs. This effect is derived here by exploring a possibility made available by the two-dimensional semantics proposed for nonrestrictive modification by Potts (2003): that different dimensions of meaning might observe fundamentally different rules with respect to the syntax-semantics mapping. Through a proposed structural asymmetry in the semantic mechanism that drives nonrestrictive interpretation, a cross-categorial account is developed of why nonparenthetical nonrestrictives occupy the positions that they do, and of how they can receive the proper interpretation in those positions.}

    abstract = {Among the principal problems in the syntax and semantics of adverbial modification is how the position and interpretation of adverbs should be related. Efforts toward addressing aspects of this question (from Jackendoff 1972 and McConnell-Ginet 1984 to Cinque 1999 and Ernst 2002) have focused primarily on adverbial modification in the verbal and sentential domain. There are, however, less prototypical uses of adverbs in the adjectival extended projection as well, and interestingly, the interpretation adverbs receive there varies predictably from the one they receive elsewhere. In this respect, adverbial modification in AP offers another perspective on the larger problem. This paper addresses the syntax and semantics of certain such `ad-adjectival' adverbs, presenting an analysis of how their interpretation arises and of how it relates to the interpretation of their counterparts outside the adjectival domain. Along the way, it touches on broader questions about how degree semantics relates to event(uality) semantics, and about how the structure of the extended AP relates to that of the extended VP with respect to adverb licensing. }

    abstract = {One of the obstacles to identifying the syntactic notion of interpretability (as applied to e.g. interpretable features) with the formal-semantic notion is that there is no agreed-upon way of assigning a denotation to bundles of more than one interpretable feature. This paper explores one means of doing so---loosening the type-theoretical demands a bit by extending the idea that function composition is available in the morphology (which is not new) to feature bundles, though in a modified form. The advantage of this is that a single denotation can be given to an interpretable feature irrespective of whether it occupies its own node or is bundled with others, thereby making possible more representationally conservative phrase structures where desirable without precluding more articulated ones where necessary. The proposal is developed and motivated in the empirical context of otherwise mysterious constraints on the relative order in English of classificatory adjectives, color adjectives, and attributive nouns of a particular sort.}

Surprisingly, though, in Polish the analogue of English such---\emph{taki}, as in \emph{taki pies} (lit. `such-\textsc{masc} dog')---also occurs in its bare form in the verbal domain, as \emph{tak} in e.g. \emph{ta\'nczy\'c} (lit. `dance-\textsc{inf} such'; `dance that way'). It is possible to extend the kind-reference analysis of adnominal \emph{taki} to its adverbial counterpart by exploiting the parallelism between individuals and Davidsonian events. But this quite straightforward path leads to an understanding of adverbial \emph{tak} in terms of a less familiar and perhaps unexpected notion: reference to kinds of events. This paper formulates an analysis framed in these terms and explores its consequences for the semantics of manner.}

An account is developed in which these adjectives are instead maximizing modifiers in the sense of Brisson (1998). This approach leads to explanations of their scopal and discourse-anaphoric properties, as well as of the determiner restrictions they impose and of how they differ from e.g. \emph{complete}. In implementing this, the notion of covers (Schwarzschild 1996) is imported in a somewhat modified form from the semantics of plurals into the semantics of singular individuals. Along the way, evidence emerges for a particular conception of choice-function indefinites (Winter 1997, Reinhart 1997, Kratzer 1998, Matthewson 1999).}
