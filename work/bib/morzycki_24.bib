    abstract = {Reference to reasons and manners is often achieved with definite descriptions: \textit{the reason she did it}, \textit{the way she did it}. That's surprising, because there is typically more than one reason for an event and more than one manner in which it took place. This squib proposes that this is because \textit{manner} and \textit{reason} are content-bearing nouns, like \textit{claim} or \textit{suggestion}, and they inherit certain crucial mereological properties from the structure of their content.},
