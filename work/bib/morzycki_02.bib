    abstract = {It is a natural and common assumption that adjectives such as \emph{whole} and \emph{entire} involve universal quantification over parts of an individual. This paper argues that in a sense exactly the opposite is true: that DPs containing \emph{whole} and \emph{entire} are obligatorily non-quantificational expressions. An account is developed in which these adjectives are instead maximizing modifiers in the sense of Brisson (1998). This approach leads to explanations of their scopal and discourse-anaphoric properties, as well as of the determiner restrictions they impose and of how they differ from e.g. \emph{complete}. In implementing this, the notion of covers (Schwarzschild 1996) is imported in a somewhat modified form from the semantics of plurals into the semantics of singular individuals. Along the way, evidence emerges for a particular conception of choice-function indefinites (Winter 1997, Reinhart 1997, Kratzer 1998, Matthewson 1999).}
