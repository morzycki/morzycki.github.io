<h2 id="about_the_book">About the book</h2>

<p>The main points, FAQ-style:</p>

<dl>

  <dt>What&rsquo;s on this page?</dt>
  <dd>Abstracts and drafts of several chapters of a book, along with a draft
    of the whole thing.</dd>

  <dt>What kind of book?</dt>
  <dd>Something between an advanced textbook for people who already have a
    background in semantics and a survey of work on the semantics of
    modification (in particular, the semantics of adjectives, adverbs, and
    degrees). For more on the purpose and scope of the book, look at chapter
    1 in the <a href="../papers/modification_book.pdf" id="book_ms" >full
    manuscript</a>.</dd>

  <dt>What&rsquo;s it called? Gimme a link to the manuscript and a BibTeX
  thinger.</dt>
  <dd><strong><a href=
    "../papers/modification_book.pdf"><em>Modification</em></a></strong>
    (just that, contrary to earlier reports of a subtitle). It&rsquo;s for
    the Cambridge University Press series <em>Key Topics in Semantics and
    Pragmatics</em>. <a href="../bib/morzycki_modificationbook.bib" class=
    "bib">BibTeX</a></dd>

<p>Below are non-final drafts of chapters as separate files. A disadvantage
  of viewing the chapters separately is that clickable links to other
  chapters don&rsquo;t work or even display properly.</p>

<ul>

  <li>

    <p>Chapter 2. <strong><a href="../papers/chapter_notscales.pdf" id=
      "chapter_lexsem" >&lsquo;The Lexical Semantics of Adjectives: More Than
      Just Scales&rsquo;</a></strong>. <a href=
      "bib/morzycki_chapter_notscales.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">One could be forgiven for getting the impression that the
      semantics of adjectives is, above all, the semantics of scales. Yet
      this would be a misimpression, as this chapter strives to demonstrate.
      It is about the lexical semantics of adjectives, but it is
      <strong>not</strong> about scales. Section 2 presents a typology of
      adjectives according the effect they have on nouns they modify. Section
      3 sketches various theoretical approaches that shed light on that
      typology. Section 4 begins the exploration of particular
      analytically-tractable classes of adjectives, focusing on adjectives
      that interact in interesting ways with their nouns. Section 5 continues
      the exploration of adjective classes, but shifts the focus to
      adjectives with surprising scope properties. Finally, section 6
      considers additional issues closely linked to the syntax of adjectives,
      including their relative order and the positions they can occupy.</p>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p>Chapter 3. <strong><a href="../papers/chapter_scales.pdf" id=
      "chapter_scales" >&lsquo;Vagueness, Degrees, and Gradable
      Predicates&rsquo;</a></strong>. <a href=
      "bib/morzycki_chapter_scales.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">The chapter begins with a discussion of vagueness in
      section 2. Section 3 gives a thumbnail sketch of theories of vagueness
      and gradability and explores one approach that hasn&rsquo;t much
      captured the imagination of formal semanticists. Sections 4 and 5
      presents two approaches that have. Section 6 compares them, considering
      the question of the status the notion &lsquo;degree&rsquo; should have
      in the grammar. Finally, section 7 turns to scalar issues in the
      lexical semantics of adjectives.</p>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p>Chapter 4. <strong><a href="../papers/chapter_comparatives.pdf" id=
      "chapter_comparatives" >&lsquo;Comparatives and Their
      Kin&rsquo;</a></strong>. <a href=
      "bib/morzycki_chapter_comparatives.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">This chapter examines the semantics of comparatives and
      their grammatical relatives, such as the equative, which positively
      bristle with subtle and often vexing puzzles. These puzzles provide
      insight into a surprisingly wide array of issues: the nature of
      comparison, of course, but also the ontology of degrees, scope taking
      mechanisms, ellipsis, negative polarity items, modality, focus,
      type-shifting, contextual domain restrictions, imprecision, and
      semantic crosslinguistic variation. This will also give us an
      opportunity to address the syntax of the extended AP in earnest for the
      first time. Section 2 confronts the mapping between syntax and
      semantics in the adjectival extended projection, with special attention
      to the comparative. Section 3 provides a tour of other degree
      constructions, including differential comparatives, equatives,
      superlatives, and others. Section 4 is the one most directly relevant
      to the puzzle we began the chapter with: the question of why the
      entailments of apparently very similar degree constructions differ
      subtly. Finally, section 5 concludes with a discussion of the
      crosslinguistic picture.</p>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p>Chapter 5. <strong><a href="../papers/chapter_adverbs.pdf" id=
      "chapter_adverbs" >&lsquo;Adverbs&rsquo;</a></strong>. <a href=
      "bib/morzycki_chapter_adverbs.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">This chapter is devoted to adverbs, a highly heterogenous
      class of modifiers that present a variety of vexing problems. Section 2
      considers how some taxonomical organization can be introduced into the
      chaos of adverbs. Section 3 then takes the first steps toward an
      analysis, wrestling with foundational compositional questions and a
      puzzle involving intensionality. Section 4 examines two classes of
      adverbs (manner and subject-oriented) in more detail. Section 5 turns
      to adverbs that occur higher in the clause. Section 6 introduces some
      facts and tools relevant to locative adverbials. Section 7 turns to the
      ill-understood phenomenon of adverbs as modifiers of adjectival
      projections. Section 8 mostly just sets aside temporal and
      quantificational adverbials. Section 9 concludes by revisiting the
      questions of the relative order of adverbs.</p>

  </li>

  <li>

    <p>Chapter 6. <strong><a href="../papers/chapter_crosscategorial.pdf" id=
      "chapter_crosscategorial" >&lsquo;Crosscategorial
      Concerns&rsquo;</a></strong>. <a href=
      "bib/morzycki_chapter_crosscategorial.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a></p>

    <p class="abs">This chapter considers, in light of the previous chapters,
      a number of crosscategorial phenomena not yet addressed. In section 2,
      we confront expressions that measure individuals by their amount, and
      the comparatives built out of these expressions. This requires
      combining our standing assumptions about degree semantics with
      assumptions and DPs an individuals. Section 3 examines the issue of
      cross-categorial gradability more broadly, focusing on verbs and nouns,
      both of which seem to be gradable in different ways and one of which
      introduces into the discussion some new parallels between individuals
      and events. Section 4 addresses the problem of crosscategorial
      modifiers that hedge or reinforce a claim, but can&rsquo;t be readily
      assimilated to the degree modifiers we&rsquo;ve already encountered in
      other domains. Section 5 focuses on an issue we&rsquo;ve systematically
      set aside throughout the book: nonrestrictive interpretations of
      modifiers, which turn out to extend far beyond relative clauses, their
      traditional home. Part of that entails struggling with what
      &lsquo;nonrestrictive&rsquo; actually means. Finally, section 6
      examines the phenomenon an aspect of meaning that is inherently
      subjective in a particular way, one that gives rise to the possibility
      of interlocutors contradicting each other truth-conditionally without
      being at odds with each other pragmatically.</p>
