  <title>Morzycki &middot; &lsquo;Metalinguistic Comparison in an Alternative
    Semantics for Imprecision&rsquo;</title>

  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

  <meta name="abstract" content="'Metalinguistic' comparatives such as 'more
    dumb than ugly' or 'more a semanticist than a syntactician' have until
    recently remained largely unexamined in the formal semantics literature
    (the principal exception is Giannakidou and Stavrou 2007). This paper
    provides an analysis of such structures built on the intuition that they
    compare not along scales introduced by gradable adjectives---as ordinary
    comparatives do---but rather along a scale of (im)precision, or of how
    much pragmatic 'slack' must be afforded to judge an expression 'close
    enough to true'. This is expressed by reformulating the pragmatic-halos
    theory of imprecision (Lasersohn 1999) in terms of a Hamblin-style
    alternative semantics (Hamblin 1973) in a way that allows degrees of
    imprecision---roughly, 'halo size'---to be directly compared." />

<p class="abs">&lsquo;Metalinguistic&rsquo; comparatives such as <em>more
