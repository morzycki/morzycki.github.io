College Hall's foundation rested on plank footings, and one corner of

wishing to preserve College Hall as a landmark, sought to rebuild the
structure as a student union. After workers found the walls to be
hollow, bricks soft and a generally unstable foundation, such plans
were dropped. </p>

In 1885, under Public Act No. 42 of Michigan, $5000 was appropriated to
build the Armory. Built by Fuller and Wheeler of Lansing, the Armory
served the campus as a gymnasium, lecture hall and ballroom, with its
primary function as a site for military drill activity. When the Armory
opened in 1886, it had a tar and gravel floor. Aside from giving off a
foul odor, the floor, when used for lectures, orations and dances,
badly soiled dresses. After a few years, a maple floor was laid.
Demonstration Hall was built to replace the Armory, and in 1939 the
structure was demolished.</p>

          <td colspan="2"><p>In
1945, approximately 30 acres of a poultry plant next to the Michigan
State Police Headquarters were cleared to make room for a village of
450 trailers. Brought in from various Michigan towns' emergency war
housing projects, they were used to shelter the growing student
enrollment. Comprised largely of returning veterans and their families,
who were among the first married students to enroll at the University. </p>
            <p>On
the East side of Harrison Road, 104 steel quonsets were erected.
Fourteen men slept in bunk beds at one end with a common room at the
other end used for studying and recreation. One oversized quonset
served as the housing community's cafeteria. </p>
          <p>The
students were joined by 50 faculty families in 31 quonset homes and 19
pre-fabricated houses. In March 1950, as dormitories such as Shaw Hall
were built for men wanting campus housing, the quonsets were abandoned.
Eventually married housing and University apartments met the housing
needs of married students and families. </p>
