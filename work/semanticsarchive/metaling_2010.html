  <title>Morzycki &middot; Book chapter: &lsquo;The Lexical Semantics of
    Adjectives: More Than Just Scales&rsquo;</title>

  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

  <meta name="abstract" content="This paper offers an analysis of
    metalinguistic comparatives such as 'more dumb than crazy' in which they
    differ from ordinary comparatives in the scale on which they compare:
    ordinary comparatives use scales lexically determined by particular
    adjectives, but metalinguistic ones use a generally available scale of
    imprecision or 'pragmatic slack'. To implement this idea, I propose a
    novel compositional implementation of Lasersohn (1999)'s pragmatic halos
    account of imprecisionâ€”one that represents clusters of similar meanings
    as Hamblin alternatives (Hamblin 1973). In the theory that results,
    existential closure over alternatives mediates between alternative-sets
    and meanings in which imprecision has been resolved. I then articulate a
    version of this theory in which the alternatives are not related meanings
    but rather related utterances, departing significantly from Lasersohn's
    original conception. Although such a theory of imprecision is more
    clearly 'metalinguistic', the evidence for it from metalinguistic
    comparatives in English is surprisingly limited. The overall picture that
    emerges is one in which the grammatical distinction between ordinary and
    metalinguistic comparatives tracks the independently-motivated
    distinction between vagueness and imprecision." />

<p class="abs">This paper offers an analysis of metalinguistic comparatives
  such as <em>more dumb than crazy</em> in which they differ from ordinary
  comparatives in the scale on which they compare: ordinary comparatives use
  scales lexically determined by particular adjectives, but metalinguistic
  ones use a generally available scale of imprecision or &lsquo;pragmatic
  slack&rsquo;. To implement this idea, I propose a novel compositional
  implementation of Lasersohn (1999)&rsquo;s pragmatic halos account of
