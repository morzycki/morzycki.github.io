<p class="abs">Degree readings of size adjectives, as in <em>big
  stamp-collector</em>, cannot be explained as merely a consequence of
  vagueness or as an extra-grammatical phenomenon. Rather, they reflect the
  grammatical architecture of nominal gradability. Such readings are
  available only for size adjectives in attributive positions, and
  systematically only for adjectives that predicate bigness. These
  restrictions can be understood as part of a broader picture of gradable NPs
  in which adnominal degree morphemes&mdash;often overt&mdash;play a key
  role, analogous to their role in AP. Size adjectives acquire degree
  readings through a degree morpheme similar to the one that licenses measure
  phrases in AP. Its syntax gives rise to positional restrictions on the
  availability of these readings, and the semantics of degree measurement
  interacts with the scale structure of size adjectives to give rise to
  restrictions on the adjective itself.</p>
