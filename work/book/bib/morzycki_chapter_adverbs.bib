    abstract = {This chapter is devoted to adverbs, a highly heterogenous class of modifiers that present a variety of vexing problems. Section 2 considers how some taxonomical organization can be introduced into the chaos of adverbs. Section 3 then takes the first steps toward an analysis, wrestling with foundational compositional questions and a puzzle involving intensionality. Section 4 examines two classes of adverbs (manner and subject-oriented) in more detail. Section 5 turns to adverbs that occur higher in the clause. Section 6 introduces some facts and tools relevant to locative adverbials. Section 7 turns to the ill-understood phenomenon of adverbs as modifiers of adjectival projections. Section 8 mostly just sets aside temporal and quantificational adverbials. Section 9 concludes by revisiting the questions of the relative order of adverbs.},
