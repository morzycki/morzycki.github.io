    abstract = {Range expressions such as 'between 3 and 8', 'from 3 to 8', and '3 through 8' resemble modified numerals such as 'at least 3' and have sometimes been mentioned under that rubric. This paper shows that they are crucially different in their distribution, the readings available to them, and their behavior with respect to quantifiers, and more generally that they have an intricate grammar of their own. We distinguish three classes of readings they can receive: singleton punctual readings, on which they often give rise to ignorance inferences; set punctual readings, which arise chiefly in the scope of quantifiers; and interval readings, where the range is interpreted exhaustively. The heart of the semantics of range expressions, we suggest, is the notion of paths, generalized from its use in the analysis of locatives to extend across semantic types.},
