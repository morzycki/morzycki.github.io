    abstract = {Bare plurals and definite descriptions are the canonical tools for achieving kind reference in English. Our focus is an additional tool that is perhaps more theoretically surprising: bare singulars that characterize musical instruments. These occur notably as arguments of verbs like 'play' and 'learn', but also in argument positions more widely. This puzzle can be understood, we suggest, if these bare singulars are taken to be, essentially, mass terms for Carlsonian kinds of events. This interacts with independent properties of definite descriptions, adjectival modification, and a light-verb form of play to yield an intricate constellation of effects, including restrictions on the availability of adverbial readings of adjectives (Stump 1985, Larson 1999, Gehrke & McNally 2015, and many others).}
