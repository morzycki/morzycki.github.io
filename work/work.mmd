  [BibTeX][bib_nonlocal]

  (abs): In certain uses, adjectives appear to make the semantic
  contribution normally associated with adverbs. These readings are often
  thought to be a peripheral phenomenon, restricted to one corner of the
  grammar and just a handful of lexical items. I’ll argue that it’s
  actually considerably more general than is often recognized, and that it
  admits two fundamentally different modes of explanation: in terms of the
  syntactic machinery that undergirds these structures and in terms of the
  ontology of the objects manipulated by its semantics. Both modes of
  explanation have been suggested for some of the puzzles in this domain,
  and I’ll argue both are necessary. With respect to adjectives including
  average and occasional, the key insight is that their lexical semantics is
  fundamentally about kinds. But to arrive at a more general theory of
  adverbial readings, it is also necessary to further articulate the
  compositional semantics. In this spirit, I’ll argue that these
  adjectives actually have the semantic type of quantificational determiners
  like every. If this way of thinking about adverbial readings is on the
  right track, it instantiates a means by which these two distinct modes of
  explanation—and the distinct aspects of cognition they may ultimately be
  associated with—both play a crucial role in bringing about the
  apparently aberrant behavior of this class of adjectives.

• To appear. ‘*[Semantic Viruses and Multiple 
  Superlatives](papers/virus_cls.pdf)*’. In _Proceedings of the Chicago 
  Linguistics Society (CLS) 54_. [BibTeX][bib_multsup]

  (abs): We don't immediately perceive the interpretation of sentences with
  multiple superlatives as particularly complicated. Their most natural
  reading involves a claim of having struck a balance between two different
  qualities. It's not clear that standard accounts of superlatives (such as
  Szabolsci 1986, Heim 1999, Sharvit & Stateva 2002) suffice to deliver
  quite this reading in a way that does it justice and distinguishes it from
  those of similar sentences we perceive as distinct. The other striking
  property of such sentences is that the relevant reading seems brittle and
  unsteady---revealingly so. This papers considers the possibility that
  these facts are an instance of a broader phenomenon: semantic viruses.
  Sobin (1994, 1997) and Lasnik & Sobin (2000) proposed that certain
  syntactic processes should be regarded as what they called grammatical
  viruses, rules that operate outside the grammar. They suggested that these
  rules are generally complicated, consciously acquired, and awkwardly
  half-internalized. If the syntax can be infected in this way, it stands to
  reason that the semantics might be as well. I argue that it may be.

  Stefánsdóttir. [BibTeX][bib_gobeski-morzycki_18]

  [SALT27]: https://journals.linguisticsociety.org/proceedings/index.php/SALT/issue/view/158

  (abs): Comparatives and equatives are usually assumed to differ only in
  that comparatives require that one degree be greater than another, while
  equatives require that it be at least as great. Unexpectedly, though, the
  interpretation of percentage measure phrases differs fundamentally between
  the constructions. This curious asymmetry is, we suggest, revealing. It
  demonstrates that comparatives and equatives are not as similar as one
  might have thought. We propose an analysis of these facts in which the
  interpretation of percentage phrases follows straightforwardly from
  standard assumptions enriched with two additional ones: that percentage
  phrases denote 'relational degrees' (type &lt;d,d&gt;) and that the
  equative morpheme is uninterpreted.

  the Syntax and Semantics of Proforms', [Deutschen Gesellschaft für
  Sprachwissenschaft (DGfS)][DGfS_2018]. University of Stuttgart. 
  [BibTeX][bib_18_slides]

  (abs): Among the more intuitively appealing and elegant ideas in the
  analysis of adjectives is that they denote measure functions (Kennedy
  1999). But as Bale 2007 pointed out, conjoined adjectives are problematic
  for this view. He, Schwarz 2010, Schwarzschild 2013, and have wrestled
  with the thorny issue of how to conjoin adjectival scales in ways that
  ultimately bear on the nature of degrees. In this talk I’ll consider how
  this problem might be approached if degrees are understood in terms of
  kinds, and what that might predict about anaphora to conjoined adjectives
  (e.g. _Donald is ignorant and unpleasant, and his son even more so_).

  (abs): Sobin (1994, 1997) proposed that certain syntactic processes should
  be regarded as what he called grammatical viruses, rules that operate
  outside the grammar and that are the result of a prescriptive
  rule---consciously acquired, awkwardly half-internalized. If the syntax
  can be infected in this way, it stands to reason that the semantics might
  be as well. I argue here that it may be. The potential viruses I’ll
  examine are the word _respectively_, factor/ratio phrases, and certain
  mathematical expressions such as _zero_ (Bylinina & Nouwen 2017). Even in
  the absence of a fully-developed theory of viruses, the benefit of
  recognizing viruses is, first, that doing so may account for empirical
  differences between viruses and the ordinary grammar, and, second, that it
  may simplify the grammar significantly.

• 2016. ‘*[Toward a General Theory of Nonlocal Readings of 
  Adjectives][nonlocal_SuB]*'. In _[Proceedings of Sinn und Bedeutung 
  20][SuB20]_. Nadine Bade, Polina Berezovskaya, and Anthea Schöller, 
  eds. Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen. [BibTeX][bib_16]

  [nonlocal_SuB]: papers/nonlocal_SuB.pdf
  [SuB20]: https://semanticsarchive.net/sub2015/BOOKLET_SuB_20.pdf
  
  (abs): Adverbial readings of adjectives (as in The occasional sailor
  strolled by) have been a longstanding curiosity, but are often thought
  peripheral and idiosyncratic. This paper argues that such nonlocal
  readings are both more common and more systematic than previously
  recognized. The empirical aim here is to demonstrate that despite some
  real idiosyncrasies, the regularities are sufficient to require a unified
  account. Adjectives that give rise to these readings fall into three
  classes distinguished by the restrictions they impose on the
  quantificational force of their determiner. These restrictions and the
  unexpected wide scope of the adjective can both be explained by assuming
  that the relevant adjectives are quantificational, trigger QR from inside
  the DP, and leave behind a type-shifted trace.

  (abs): This paper argues that a variety of constructions in a variety of
  languages suggest a deep connection between kinds, manners, and degrees.
  We articulate a way of thinking about degrees on which this connection is
  less surprising, rooted in the idea that degrees are kinds of Davidsonian
  states. This enables us to provide a cross-categorial compositional
  semantics for a class of expressions that are can serve as anaphors to
  kinds, manners, and degrees, and can introduce clauses that further
  characterize them. This puts equatives in a new light: as a special case
  of a cross-categorial phenomenon. Our analysis of these constructions
  builds on independently motivated assumptions about free relatives and
  type shifting. This provides evidence for a view of degrees on which they
  are significantly more ontologically complex than is standardly assumed.

• 2011. *['The Several Faces of Adnominal Degree 
  Modification'][faces_of_nom_deg_mod]*. Appeared in 2012 in the _[Proceedings 
  of the 29th West Coast Conference on Formal Linguistics 
  (WCCFL)][WCCFL29]_. Jaehoon Choi, E. Alan Hogue, Jeffrey Punske, Deniz 
  Tat, Jessamyn Schertz, and Alex Trueman, eds. Cascadilla Press, 
  Somerville, Mass. [BibTeX][bib_facesofnomdegmod] 
  
  (abs): This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ from their
  more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of variation among
  them is the means by which a gradable predicate is derived from a noun
  meaning. The empirical starting point is the contrast between the degree
  modifiers _real_, _big_, and _utter_, each of which imposes different
  constraints on what nouns it can modify. The _real_ class is relatively
  unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales of
  prototypicality. Size adjectives such as _big_ are less flexible: _real
  sportscar_ has a degree reading but _big sportscar_ does not. Degree
  modifiers such as _utter_ are more constrained still: _big smoker_ has a

          nouns it can modify. The \emph{real} class is relatively

  These facts suggest that a theory is required of what it means for an

  idea that in any given context, we restrict our attention to a particular
  salient portion of a scale. To reflect this, I suggest that quantification

  Imprecision'][metaling_2010]*. Appeared in 2011 in _[Natural Language
  Semantics][NALS]_ 19(1): 39--86. The link is to a pre-publication version.
  The final version is [here][metaling_NALS]. [BibTeX][bib_metaling]

  (abs): This paper offers an analysis of metalinguistic comparatives such as
  _more dumb than crazy_ in which they differ from ordinary comparatives in
  the scale on which they compare: ordinary comparatives use scales lexically
  determined by particular adjectives, but metalinguistic ones use a
  generally available scale of imprecision or 'pragmatic slack'. To
  implement this idea, I propose a novel compositional implementation of
  Lasersohn (1999)’s pragmatic halos account of imprecision—one that
  represents clusters of similar meanings as Hamblin alternatives (Hamblin
  1973). In the theory that results, existential closure over alternatives
  mediates between alternative-sets and meanings in which imprecision has been
  resolved. I then articulate a version of this theory in which the
  alternatives are not related meanings but rather related utterances,
  departing significantly from Lasersohn’s original conception. Although
  such a theory of imprecision is more clearly ‘metalinguistic’, the
  evidence for it from metalinguistic comparatives in English is surprisingly
  limited. The overall picture that emerges is one in which the grammatical
  distinction between ordinary and metalinguistic comparatives tracks the
  independently-motivated distinction between vagueness and imprecision.
  
  (abs): (This is a much elaborated version of [an older
  paper](#metaling_NELS) that appeared in the proceedings of NELS&nbsp;38
  under the same title. The main difference is that this spells out the
  compositional semantics more explicitly and includes more discussion of just
  how 'metalinguistic' metalinguistic comparatives are.)

	largely unexamined in the formal semantics literature (the principal
	exception is [Giannakidou and Stavrou 2007][anastasia_paper]). This paper

  (abs): Degree readings of size adjectives, as in _big idiot_,
  cannot be explained as merely a consequence of vagueness or as an
  extra-grammatical phenomenon. Rather, they reflect the grammatical
  architecture of nominal gradability. Such readings are available only for
  size adjectives in attributive positions, and systematically only for
  adjectives that predicate bigness. These restrictions can be understood
  as part of a broader picture of gradable NPs in which adnominal degree
  morphemes---often overt---play a key role, analogous to their role in AP.
  Size adjectives acquire degree readings through a degree morpheme similar
  to the one that licenses measure phrases in AP. Its syntax gives rise to
  positional restrictions on the availability of these readings, and the
  semantics of degree measurement interacts with the scale structure of size
  adjectives to give rise to restrictions on the adjective itself.

          similar to the one that licenses measure phrases in AP. Its syntax
          gives rise to positional restrictions on the availability of these
          readings, and the semantics of degree measurement interacts with
          the scale structure of size adjectives to give rise to restrictions
          on the adjective itself.}

  in fact unusual, and that differential MPs (as in _six feet taller_) are
  actually the unmarked case (Schwarzschild 2005 directly, and more
  indirectly Kennedy & Levin (2008) and Svenonius & Kennedy 2006). This

  (abs): The systematic but often subtle semantic differences between
  prenominal and postnominal adjectives noted by Bolinger (1967) and others
  in many respects remain poorly understood. A similar murkiness surrounds
  many of the differences between preverbal and postverbal adverbs. This
  paper examines an intriguing parallel between these domains: in English,
  a nonrestrictive interpretation is possible without parenthetical
  intonation for prenominal adjectives and preverbal adverbs, but not for
  postnominal adjectives and postverbal adverbs. This effect is derived
  here by exploring a possibility made available by the two-dimensional
  semantics proposed for nonrestrictive modification by Potts (2003):
  that different dimensions of meaning might observe fundamentally
  different rules with respect to the syntax-semantics mapping. Through
  a proposed structural asymmetry in the semantic mechanism that drives
  nonrestrictive interpretation, a cross-categorial account is developed of
  why nonparenthetical nonrestrictives occupy the positions that they do, and
  of how they can receive the proper interpretation in those positions.

  (abs): This paper relates two issues normally considered separately: the
  licensing conditions on AP- and PP-modifying measure phrases (such as _six
  feet_ in _six feet above the barn_) and the atelicity restriction imposed
  by certain temporal adverbials. These questions are given a common answer:
  both classes of expressions are subject to an independently-motivated
  cross-categorial monotonicity condition on measure-phrase modification,
  the Modification Condition (Zwarts and Winter 2000, Winter 2001, 2004) of
  Vector Space Semantics. To make this connection, the vector space approach
  is extended to temporal semantics and independent evidence is marshaled for
  assimilating some temporal adverbials to measure phrases. I also pursue
  a cross-categorial syntax and semantics for measure-phrase modification
  that may blunt certain arguments in favor of the ontological enrichments
  advocated in Vector Space Semantics.

  (abs): Although the traditional focus of research into degree modification
  has been the adjectival extended projection, it has long been recognized
  that degree modification or something quite like it is possible in other
  categories as well. The conditions under which it is possible, though,
  and mechanisms that bring it about remain largely mysterious. This paper
  examines one peculiar species of such modification, exemplified by _that
  enormous idiot_ or _a big beer-drinker_, in which a size adjective
  characterizes a degree associated with the modified noun. Across a number
  of languages, these readings manifest two intriguing properties: they
  are possible prenominally but not postnominally, and systematically
  with adjectives that predicate bigness but not with ones that predicate
  smallness. In the compositional semantics ultimately proposed here, these
  generalizations follow from a restriction on how degrees on one scale can
  be mapped to degrees on another and from an independently-motivated close
  syntactic parallel between the nominal and adjectival extended projections.

  [BibTeX][bib_04b]

  [MPs_in_VP]: papers/MPs_in_VP.pdf
    
  (abs): This paper seeks to establish that measure phrases in the extended AP
  and PP---such as _six feet tall_ and _twenty minutes before midnight_---have
  a direct counterpart in the verbal domain. These verbal measure phrases,
  exemplified in English in e.g. _He slept several hours_, constitute a
  natural class distinct from other DP adverbials and characterized by
  obligatorily narrow scope, low structural position, an Aktionsart-related
  presupposition, and quantificationally weak interpretations. This
  constellation of characteristics is shown to follow naturally from the view
  that these expressions mirror core syntactic and semantic properties of AP
  and PP measure phrases. In particular, it will be argued here that these
  expressions have a syntax that places them in the specifier of a functional
  projection, just as has long been assumed for AP/PP measure phrases and
  as has been proposed in a different and independent line of research for
  adverbials more generally; and that they have a semantics in which they
  are interpreted as arguments of the head of this licensing projection, and
  therefore scopally and distributionally constrained and implicated in the
  aspectual semantics of the clause. Aktionsart information which cannot
  plausibly come from the DP itself is thereby attributed instead to a verbal
  feature responsible for licensing the adverbial. Independent evidence for
  this approach is adduced from true adverbs and parallels with proposals made
  in the analysis of accusative adverbials in Slavic and in Finnish.

  (abs): Among the principal problems in the syntax and semantics of adverbial
  modification is how the position and interpretation of adverbs should be
  related. Efforts toward addressing aspects of this question (from Jackendoff
  1972 and McConnell-Ginet 1984 to Cinque 1999 and Ernst 2002) have focused
  primarily on adverbial modification in the verbal and sentential domain.
  There are, however, less prototypical uses of adverbs in the adjectival
  extended projection as well, and interestingly, the interpretation adverbs
  receive there varies predictably from the one they receive elsewhere. In
  this respect, adverbial modification in AP offers another perspective
  on the larger problem. This paper addresses the syntax and semantics of
  certain such ‘ad-adjectival’ adverbs, presenting an analysis of how
  their interpretation arises and of how it relates to the interpretation of
  their counterparts outside the adjectival domain. Along the way, it touches
  on broader questions about how degree semantics relates to event(uality)
  semantics, and about how the structure of the extended AP relates to that of
  the extended VP with respect to adverb licensing.

  bit by extending the idea that function composition is available in the
  morphology (which is not new) to feature bundles, though in a modified
  form. The advantage of this is that a single denotation can be given to an
  interpretable feature irrespective of whether it occupies its own node or
  is bundled with others, thereby making possible more representationally
  conservative phrase structures where desirable without precluding more
  articulated ones where necessary. The proposal is developed and motivated

  kind (in the sense of Carlson 1977). Such an understanding is quite
  natural in part because it is well-established that reference to kinds
  is possible in the nominal domain. Surprisingly, though, in Polish the
  analogue of English such---_taki_, as in _taki pies_ (lit. ‘such-<span
  class="sc">masc</span> dog’)---also occurs in its bare form in the
  verbal domain, as _tak_ in e.g. _tańczyć tak_ (lit. ‘dance-<span
  class="sc">inf</span> such’; ‘dance that way’). It is possible to
  extend the kind-reference analysis of adnominal _taki_ to its adverbial
  counterpart by exploiting the parallelism between individuals and
  Davidsonian events. But this quite straightforward path leads to an
  understanding of adverbial _tak_ in terms of a less familiar and perhaps
  unexpected notion: reference to kinds of events. This paper formulates
  an analysis framed in these terms and explores its consequences for the

  (abs): It is a natural and common assumption that adjectives such as

  is true: that DPs containing _whole_ and _entire_ are obligatorily
  non-quantificational expressions. An account is developed in which these
  adjectives are instead maximizing modifiers in the sense of Brisson (1998).
  This approach leads to explanations of their scopal and discourse-anaphoric
  properties, as well as of the determiner restrictions they impose and of
  how they differ from e.g. _complete_. In implementing this, the notion of
  covers (Schwarzschild 1996) is imported in a somewhat modified form from
  the semantics of plurals into the semantics of singular individuals. Along
  the way, evidence emerges for a particular conception of choice-function
  indefinites (Winter 1997, Reinhart 1997, Kratzer 1998, Matthewson 1999).

%  (abs): This abstract is being written many years after the paper, so it's
%  more a brief re-evaluation than an abstract. In retrospect, there were two
%  basic points, and a kludgey proposal to address them. The first of these is
%  that there needs to be a unified, cross-categorial theory of what _almost_
%  means. The cross-categoriality of _almost_ had been discussed at the
%  clausal, VP, and AP level, primarily in work whose main focus is lexical
%  decomposition. It had also long been recognized that _almost_ can occur in
%  DP, in e.g. _almost every plant_.
%  %  These, however, are fundamentally different kinds of categories
%  %  semantically: DPs denote generalized quantifiers, whereas all the other
%  %  categories can be understood to be properties of various types.
%  Yet analytically, these uses were typically considered separately. I argued
%  that this distinction can't be maintained, because it is not a peculiarity
%  of _almost_ that it can occur in DP as well as in other
%  categories---rather, a large class of modifiers have this distribution,
%  including _nearly_, _virtually_, and _practically_. The second point is that
%  the then-available accounts of _almost_ couldn't generalize to the DP
%  use unproblematically. The principal difficulty is that they predict that
%  _Almost every plant is dry_ should mean roughly the same thing as _It is
%  almost the case that every plant is dry_. But in fact, if every plant is
%  almost dry and none is actually dry, the former is false and the latter is
%  true. 
%: NB: slightly fucked up abstract; in fact, R&S provide the plant example, and seem to think that they can account for the difference by scoping 'every plant' above or below 'almost'...  but that would get a universal incomplete-wetness reading (with wide scope every) or a weaker sentence ambiguous between the two readings (with wide scope almost); what it wouldn't give you is the unamibiguous reading _almost every plant_ actually gets... indeed, their _almost_ is propositional, so it couldn't even have this constituency...
%  After considering a number of other options, I settle on an
%  elaboration of intensional treatments of _almost_ in which the additional
%  restrictions on the DP reading are more or less stipulated. When a kludge is
%  resorted to often enough, one normally decides that it is instead a
%  Principle. That is the course I adopted, arguing that the mechanism
%  underlying this stipulation is in fact widely necessary in the grammar of
%  modification.
%  % (for more on this, see [this paper](#features)).
%  (There has subsequently been a fair bit of work that addresses these
%  concerns. An especially direct 
%  discussion
%  % response to this paper 
%  % (I am tempted to say 'refutation') 
%  can be found in [Penka 2006][penka_paper].)

  %  Research on _almost_ has typically focused on either its adverbial use
  %  (e.g. _Clyde almost killed Floyd_) or its adnominal use (e.g. _Almost
  %  every chiropractor plays the ukulele_).
  %
  %     But this cannot be the case. If it were indeed some accident of the
  %  lexicon that almost manifests these two apparently divergent sets of
  %  syntactic and semantic characteristics, it should be unique, or nearly
  %  so, in this respect. Yet in fact, almost shares all of its essential
  %  characteristics with a natural class of modifiers – henceforth
  %  ‘almost modifiers’ – of which it is one quite unexceptional member.
  %  Among its kin in this class are virtually, nearly, damn near, pretty
  %  much, not quite, and just about (though not bare about). All the
  %  modifiers of this class occur in the same positions, give rise to the
  %  same range of readings, and impose similar restrictions on the
  %  expressions they modify. Moreover, the restrictions they impose on
  %  different categories are intuitively similar to each other. Thus, because
  %  almost shares its properties with a significantly larger class of
  %  expressions, its behavior in the nominal and verbal domains can be no
  %  accident, but rather must reflect a more general puzzle.
  %     The aim here is to elucidate that puzzle and suggest an approach to
  %  solving it. The essential distinguishing properties of the almost class
  %  are examined in section 1. Several possible approaches to the problem are
  %  considered in section 2. Then, in section 3, an analysis of almost
  %  modifiers in terms of intensional similarity is pursued that may be
  %  extended across categories. The remaining steps toward an account of this
  %  cross-categoriality are taken in section 4, which proposes a division of
  %  semantic labor between almost modifiers themselves and a syntactic
  %  feature in functional structure that licenses them. Section 5 concludes.
