(abs): This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ from their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of variation among them is the means by which a gradable predicate is derived from a noun meaning. The empirical starting point is the contrast between the degree modifiers _real_, _big_, and _utter_, each of which imposes different constraints on what nouns it can modify. The _real_ class is relatively unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales of prototypicality. Size adjectives such as _big_ are less flexible: _real sportscar_ has a degree reading but _big sportscar_ does not. Degree modifiers such as _utter_ are more constrained still: _big smoker_ has a degree reading but _<sup>#</sup>utter smoker_ is ill-formed. I suggest that both _big_ and _utter_ access dimensions of gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that _utter_ also imposes the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability differ.

|ABSTRACT|: This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ from their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of variation among them is the means by which a gradable predicate is derived from a noun meaning. The empirical starting point is the contrast between the degree modifiers 'real', 'big', and 'utter', each of which imposes different constraints on what nouns it can modify. The 'real' class is relatively unconstrained, and seems to achieve gradable interpretations via scales of prototypicality. Size adjectives such as 'big' are less flexible: 'real sportscar' has a degree reading but 'big sportscar' does not. Degree modifiers such as 'utter' are more constrained still: 'big smoker' has a degree reading but '#utter smoker' is ill-formed. I suggest that both 'big' and 'utter' access dimensions of gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that 'utter' also imposes the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability differ.
