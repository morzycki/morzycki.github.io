    abstract = {This paper motivates a modal analysis of propositional \textit{how}, which occurs in questions that ask for explanations such as `How are you not cold right now?' (Jaworski 2009, Pak 2017). Building on Pak 2017, we show propositional \textit{how} behaves differently from manner \textit{how} with respect to embedding, negative islands, stative predicates, and modals. Furthermore, it contrasts with \textit{why} in its incredulity flavor and interaction with modals.},
