    title = {The Landscape of Nonlocal Readings of Adjectives},
    abstract = {It is an interesting curiosity that \emph{occasional} can get an adverb-like reading in which it seems to scope outside its DP (Bolinger 1967, Stump 1981, Larson 1999, Zimmermann 2003, Schäfer 2007, DeVries 2010, Gehrke & McNally 2010). This is the paradigm case of ‘adverbial’ or nonlocal readings of adjectives. What seems not to have attracted sufficient attention is that such nonlocal readings of adjectives have been observed in quite a number of other constructions. My aim in this talk is to take a wider view of these facts than is customary. An important first step, I believe, is to recognize that across the class, such readings are never available with strong inherently quantificational determiners, and that the class divides in two with respect to the behavior of weak ones. I explore some analytical alternatives that capture parts of the bigger picture.},
