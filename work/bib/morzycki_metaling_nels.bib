    abstract = {`Metalinguistic' comparatives such as \emph{more dumb than ugly} or \emph{more a semanticist than a syntactician} have until recently remained largely unexamined in the formal semantics literature. This paper provides an analysis of such structures built on the intuition that they compare not along scales introduced by gradable adjectives---as ordinary comparatives do---but rather along a scale of (im)precision, or of how much pragmatic `slack' must be afforded to judge an expression `close enough to true'. This is expressed by reformulating the pragmatic-halos theory of imprecision (Lasersohn 1999) in terms of a Hamblin-style alternative semantics (Hamblin 1973) in a way that allows degrees of imprecision---roughly, `halo size'---to be directly compared.},
    annote = {This paper has a longer, more developed counterpart, which appeared in Natural Language Semantics.}
