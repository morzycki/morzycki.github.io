Hi. Here's the basic information:

  |what I work on:|
    semantics and the syntax-semantics interface 
      %(which is part of theoretical linguistics)
      %(for elaboration, look at [this](interests/))

%Here are some FAQs and their answers:
%
%|How do you pronounce your name?|
%    In 
%    [IPA](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa), it's <span 
%    class="IPA">[ˈmɑɹsɪnmɔɹˈzɪki]</span>. (If you can't 
%    read IPA, you should take a linguistics course. If you see a series of
%    boxes due to font problems, do not assume my name is pronounced as a
%    series of boxes.) This is Anglicized Polish. 
%    %It's Polish. (My name, not your browser.) 
%    People who know anything about Polish understandably find it appalling.
%    %are horrified by this pronunciation. 
%    The non-Anglicized version is <span
%    class="IPA">[ˈmart͡ɕinmɔˈʐɨt͡ski]</span>, but virtually no one calls me
%    that.
%    
%|You're lying above about the name of your department. Why?|
%    The full 
%    name of my department is 'Department of Linguistics and Germanic, Slavic, 
%    Asian, and African Languages'. This is because MSU likes having really 
%    large departments, so linguistics and all non-Romance languages are
%    bundled together. Obviously, the real name is an unwieldy monstrosity, so
%    people normally just say 'Linguistics and Languages'.
%
%|Intellectually, whose fault are you?|
%    My dissertation committee was chaired by Angelika Kratzer, and I worked a
%    lot with Barbara Partee, Kyle Johnson, and Lisa Matthewson.
%    As an undergrad, I did a thesis with Sandy Chung. 
%    %My undergrad thesis advisor was Sandy Chung.
%    Please don't blame any of them. 
%    %They did what they could with what they had to work with.

If you're wondering how to pronounce my name: in [IPA](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa), it's <span class="IPA">[ˈmɑɹsɪnmɔɹˈzɪki]</span>. This is Anglicized Polish. %It's Polish. (My name, not your browser.) 
People who know anything about Polish understandably find it appalling. %are horrified by this pronunciation. 
The non-Anglicized version is <span class="IPA">[ˈmart͡ɕinmɔˈʐɨt͡ski]</span>, but very few people call me that. (If you can't read IPA, you should take a linguistics course. If you just see a series of boxes due to font problems, don't assume my name is pronounced as a series of boxes.)
%If you're wondering how to pronounce my name, can read [IPA](http://www.langsci.ucl.ac.uk/ipa), and have a browser that displays it properly, it's <span class="IPA">[ˈmɑɹsɪnmɔɹˈzɪki]</span>. This is Anglicized Polish.
%%It's Polish. (My name, not your browser.) 
%%If you know anything at all about Polish you will be horrified and offended by this pronunciation. In actual Polish, it would be []. I was imported into the US at age six. This is not an age at which it's easy to persuade people to pronounce Polish names in Polish, so it got Anglicized pretty fast. 

Also, '[Department of Linguistics and Germanic, Slavic, Asian, and African Languages][dept_main]' is pronounced 'Linguistics and Languages'. 
%Its content is: <blockquote><p>{&thinsp;_x_:&nbsp;_x_&nbsp;=*linguistics*&nbsp;∨&nbsp;(&nbsp;*language*(_x_)&nbsp;∧&nbsp;¬*romance*(_x_)&nbsp;)&thinsp;}</p></blockquote>

[dept_main]: http://linglang.msu.edu

%You might also be wondering why the department I work in is officially not the 'Department of Linguistics and Languages' as I have it above, but rather the 'Department of Linguistics and Germanic, Slavic, Asian, and African Languages'. 
%Even now, after many years of working in it, 
%I might also be wondering this.  

%: ADD?:
%: 
%:   • intellectual biography of some kind, including mention of Angelika,
%:     Sandy, etc
%:   • deal on my name, w/ ipa pronunciation and Polish story?
%:   • 'welcome' or some such?
%:   • more explicit contact info, w/ 'by email', 'by snail mail', etc?
%:   • conceivably some separate 'about me' thing? with lies and truth
%:     intermingled? 'briefly served as the first female pope' etc., end with
%:     'some of this was true'
%:   • add 'known allergies' or 'blood type' to list of info? maybe too subtle
%:   • list of best fortune cookies? maybe scanned? 
%:   • link to ridiculous photos of east lansing, maybe just by clicking on
%:     'EL'? 
%:   • on teaching page, maybe mention hampshire stuff, including the crazy
%:     course?
%:   • a FAQ thing including how to pronunce name; what's the deal on the
%:     dept name; what can I do with a linguistics major, etc.
%:     

%This is all work stuff. If you want to know about me personally, then%
%, uh, 
%seriously, 
%you really need find to someone more interesting to cyberstalk.
