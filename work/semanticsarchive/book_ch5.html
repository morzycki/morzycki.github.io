  <meta name="abstract" content="This chapter is devoted to adverbs, a highly
    heterogenous class of modifiers that present a variety of vexing

    steps toward an analysis, wrestling with foundational compositional
    questions and a puzzle involving intensionality. Section 4 examines two
    classes of adverbs (manner and subject-oriented) in more detail. Section
    5 turns to adverbs that occur higher in the clause. Section 6 introduces
    some facts and tools relevant to locative adverbials. Section 7 turns to
    the ill-understood phenomenon of adverbs as modifiers of adjectival
    projections. Section 8 mostly just sets aside temporal and
    quantificational adverbials. Section 9 concludes by revisiting the
    questions of the relative order of adverbs." />

  >&lsquo;Adverbs&rsquo;</a></strong>. This is a chapter of an in-preparation
  book to be called <em>Modification</em> (in the Cambridge University Press
  series <em>Key Topics in Semantics an Pragmatics</em>). The book is
  something between a textbook for people with a basic background in
  semantics and an introductory survey of work on the semantics of
  modification. <a href="http://msu.edu/~morzycki/work/book" id="book_site"

  also available. <a class="bib" href=
