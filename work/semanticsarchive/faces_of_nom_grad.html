  <title>Morzycki &middot; &lsquo;The Several Faces of Adnominal Degree
    Modification&rsquo;</title>

  <meta name="abstract" content="This paper argues that adnominal degree
    modifiers differ from their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a

    constrained still: 'big smoker' has a degree reading but '#utter smoker'
    is ill-formed. I suggest that both 'big' and 'utter' access dimensions of
    gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that 'utter' also imposes
    the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension. The

<p class="abs">This paper argues that adnominal degree modifiers differ from
  their more familiar adjectival cousins in that a major axis of variation
  among them is the means by which a gradable predicate is derived from a
  noun meaning. The empirical starting point is the contrast between the
  degree modifiers <em>real</em>, <em>big</em>, and <em>utter</em>, each of
  which imposes different constraints on what nouns it can modify. The
  <em>real</em> class is relatively unconstrained, and seems to achieve
  gradable interpretations via scales of prototypicality. Size adjectives
  such as <em>big</em> are less flexible: <em>real sportscar</em> has a
  degree reading but <em>big sportscar</em> does not. Degree modifiers such
  as <em>utter</em> are more constrained still: <em>big smoker</em> has a
  degree reading but <em><sup>#</sup>utter smoker</em> is ill-formed. I
  suggest that both <em>big</em> and <em>utter</em> access dimensions of
  gradability lexically provided by the noun, but that <em>utter</em> also
  imposes the presupposition that the noun provides only one such dimension.
  The hope is that a theory of such distinctions represents a step toward a
  typology of adnominal degree expressions, which may in turn reveal
  something more general about how nominal and adjectival gradability
  differ.</p>
