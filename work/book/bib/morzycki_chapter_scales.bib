    abstract = {The chapter begins with a discussion of vagueness in section 2. Section 3 gives a thumbnail sketch of theories of vagueness and gradability and explores one approach that hasn't much captured the imagination of formal semanticists. Sections 4 and 5 presents two approaches that have. Section 6 compares them, considering the question of the status the notion 'degree' should have in the grammar. Finally, section 7 turns to scalar issues in the lexical semantics of adjectives.},
