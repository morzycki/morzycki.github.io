  <title>Morzycki &middot; Book chapter: &lsquo;Comparatives and Their
    Kin&rsquo;</title>

  <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />

  <meta name="abstract" content="This chapter examines the semantics of
    comparatives and their grammatical relatives, such as the equative, which
    positively bristle with subtle and often vexing puzzles. These puzzles
    provide insight into a surprisingly wide array of issues: the nature of
    comparison, of course, but also the ontology of degrees, scope taking
    mechanisms, ellipsis, negative polarity items, modality, focus,
    type-shifting, contextual domain restrictions, imprecision, and semantic
    crosslinguistic variation. This will also give us an opportunity to
    address the syntax of the extended AP in earnest for the first time.
    Section 2 confronts the mapping between syntax and semantics in the
    adjectival extended projection, with special attention to the
    comparative. Section 3 provides a tour of other degree constructions,
    including differential comparatives, equatives, superlatives, and others.
    Section 4 is the one most directly relevant to the puzzle we began the
    chapter with: the question of why the entailments of apparently very
    similar degree constructions differ subtly. Finally, section 5 concludes
    with a discussion of the crosslinguistic picture." />

<p>Morzycki, Marcin. 2013. <strong><a href=
  "http://msu.edu/~morzycki/work/papers/chapter_comparatives.pdf" id=
  "chapter" >&lsquo;Comparatives and Their Kin&rsquo;</a></strong>. This is a
  chapter of an in-preparation book to be called <em>Modification</em> (in
  the Cambridge University Press series <em>Key Topics in Semantics an
  Pragmatics</em>). The book is something between a textbook for people with
  a basic background in semantics and an introductory survey of work on the
  semantics of modification. <a href="http://msu.edu/~morzycki/work/book" id=
  "book_site" >More information about the whole project and additional
  chapters</a> are also available. I&rsquo;d really appreciate any feedback
  on this. <a class="bib" href=
