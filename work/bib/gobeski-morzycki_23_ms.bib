    abstract = {Purely numerical measure phrases (MPs) that lack a unit term---such as 'three' or 'two thirds'---are normally treated as denoting degrees on a single shared numerical scale. This paper examines an apparently unrecognized class of complex purely numerical MPs including 'two in three' and 'six to one', which we term 'composite MPs' because they have other MPs as subconstituents. They demonstrate, we argue, that mathematically equivalent MPs aren’t equivalent in their distribution and in their semantics. These differences can be related to restrictions on what sort of objects different MPs can measure. They can be captured by enriching the theoretical notion of degrees with tropes (as advocated in a line of work by Friederike Moltmann). Some MPs, such as sports scores, require taking a further step: embracing tuples of degrees as a sort of degree. We classify composite MPs into three varieties, provide diagnostics for each of them. The inquiry has ramifications for broader questions about the relationship between the facts of the world and how they are encoded in language.},

• 2023. With Adam Gobeski. ‘*[Ranges: Composite Measure Phrases, Modified 
Numerals, and Choice Functions](https://doi.org/10.3765/salt.v1i0.5349)*’. In _Proceedings of Semantics and Linguistic Theory (SALT) 32_. [BibTeX][bib_gobeski-morzycki_ranges]

(abs): Range expressions such as _between 3 and 8_, _from 3 to 8_, and _3 through 8_ resemble modified numerals such as _at least 3_ and have sometimes been mentioned under that rubric. This paper shows that they are crucially different in their distribution, the readings available to them, and their behavior with respect to quantifiers, and more generally that they have an intricate grammar of their own. We distinguish three classes of readings they can receive: singleton punctual readings, on which they often give rise to ignorance inferences; set punctual readings, which arise chiefly in the scope of quantifiers; and interval readings, where the range is interpreted exhaustively. We propose an analysis on which range expressions denote choice functions over degrees, which can in the right circumstances be parameterized.

(abs): There's a completely different (and much better!) analysis of mostly the same data [above](#ranges).
