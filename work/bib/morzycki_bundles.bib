    abstract = {One of the obstacles to identifying the syntactic notion of interpretability (as applied to e.g. interpretable features) with the formal-semantic notion is that there is no agreed-upon way of assigning a denotation to bundles of more than one interpretable feature. This paper explores one means of doing so---loosening the type-theoretical demands a bit by extending the idea that function composition is available in the morphology (which is not new) to feature bundles, though in a modified form. The advantage of this is that a single denotation can be given to an interpretable feature irrespective of whether it occupies its own node or is bundled with others, thereby making possible more representationally conservative phrase structures where desirable without precluding more articulated ones where necessary. The proposal is developed and motivated in the empirical context of otherwise mysterious constraints on the relative order in English of classificatory adjectives, color adjectives, and attributive nouns of a particular sort.}
