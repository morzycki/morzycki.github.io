    abstract = {What does it mean to modify an expression with the word 'zero', as in 'Zero capybaras arrived'? One leading idea (Bylinina & Nouwen 2018) is that 'zero' is like other numerals and that it introduces existential quantification over plural individuals whose cardinality is 0, i.e., null individuals. The aim of this talk is in part to bring crosslinguistic evidence to bear on this idea, exploring the grammar of zero in Cantonese and in Ktunaxa, an endangered languages spoken in parts of Canada and the US. Intriguingly, Ktunaxa expresses zero with a predicate of absence (roughly, 'that which is absent'). This will lead us to reflect on predicating absence more generally as a species of negative existential.},
