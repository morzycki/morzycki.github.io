    abstract = {Eventive readings of non-eventive nominals are systematically possible in English in more or less arbitrary argument positions, we will show, when the noun belongs to a narrow but productive class that includes terms for games and musical instruments—and in the right discourse contexts, other nouns too. On the object reading, these nouns are count, but on the eventive reading, they are necessarily semantically mass. These readings are also possible under a wide variety of determiners. They can even be expressed with bare singular DP arguments, which are of course not generally possible in English. We treat these uses as the result of a semantic shift that approximates the the effects of gerundive nominalization: for example, it may map piano to something like ’piano playing’. Building on previous work Greeson et al. (to appear), we demonstrate that these assumptions—along with typical assumptions about kind reference and event kinds—make possible an explanation of the curious behavior of definite descriptions and bare singulars with play (e.g. 'play (the) piano'). That includes finer-grained facts about kind reference, event kinds, adverbial readings of adjectives, and classificatory/relational adjectives (i.e. subkind modifiers).},
