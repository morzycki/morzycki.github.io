Morzycki, Marcin. 2013. *['Comparatives and Their Kin'][chapter]*. This is a chapter of an in-preparation book to be called _Modification_ (in the Cambridge University Press series _Key Topics in Semantics an Pragmatics_). The book is something between a textbook for people with a basic background in semantics and an introductory survey of work on the semantics of modification. [More information about the whole project and additional chapters][book_site] are also available. I'd really appreciate any feedback on this. <a class="bib" href="http://msu.edu/~morzycki/work/book/bib/morzycki_chapter_comparatives.bib">BibTeX</a> 

(abs): This chapter examines the semantics of comparatives and their grammatical relatives, such as the equative, which positively bristle with subtle and often vexing puzzles. These puzzles provide insight into a surprisingly wide array of issues: the nature of comparison, of course, but also the ontology of degrees, scope taking mechanisms, ellipsis, negative polarity items, modality, focus, type-shifting, contextual domain restrictions, imprecision, and semantic crosslinguistic variation. This will also give us an opportunity to address the syntax of the extended AP in earnest for the first time. Section 2 confronts the mapping between syntax and semantics in the adjectival extended projection, with special attention to the comparative. Section 3 provides a tour of other degree constructions, including differential comparatives, equatives, superlatives, and others. Section 4 is the one most directly relevant to the puzzle we began the chapter with: the question of why the entailments of apparently very similar degree constructions differ subtly. Finally, section 5 concludes with a discussion of the crosslinguistic picture.

|ABSTRACT|: This chapter examines the semantics of comparatives and their grammatical relatives, such as the equative, which positively bristle with subtle and often vexing puzzles. These puzzles provide insight into a surprisingly wide array of issues: the nature of comparison, of course, but also the ontology of degrees, scope taking mechanisms, ellipsis, negative polarity items, modality, focus, type-shifting, contextual domain restrictions, imprecision, and semantic crosslinguistic variation. This will also give us an opportunity to address the syntax of the extended AP in earnest for the first time. Section 2 confronts the mapping between syntax and semantics in the adjectival extended projection, with special attention to the comparative. Section 3 provides a tour of other degree constructions, including differential comparatives, equatives, superlatives, and others. Section 4 is the one most directly relevant to the puzzle we began the chapter with: the question of why the entailments of apparently very similar degree constructions differ subtly. Finally, section 5 concludes with a discussion of the crosslinguistic picture.
