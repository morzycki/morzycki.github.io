About the book
——————————————

The main points, FAQ-style:

  |What's on this page?|
    Abstracts and drafts of several chapters of a book, along with a draft
    of the whole thing.

  |What kind of book?|
    Something between an advanced textbook for people who already have a
    background in semantics and a survey of work on the semantics of
    modification (in particular, the semantics of adjectives, adverbs, and
    degrees). For more on the purpose and scope of the book, look at
    chapter 1 in the [full manuscript][book_ms].

  |What's it called? Gimme a link to the manuscript and a BibTeX thinger.|
  %  |title, bibliographic info, and link to full manuscript:|
    *[_Modification_][book_ms]* (just that, contrary to earlier reports of a 
    subtitle). It's for the Cambridge University Press series _Key Topics 
    in Semantics and Pragmatics_.
    <a href="../bib/morzycki_modificationbook.bib" class="bib">BibTeX</a>
      %: Link done manually so that it uses the bibtex info provided on
      %: research page rather than repeating it here. Better to have it on
      %: that page so that it's automatically included in the
      %: full-bibliography bib file download.

%  |Should I point out mistakes and oversights or otherwise provide feedback?| 
%    Definitely. Email me. (My last name at msu.edu.)
  
%Basic info:
%
%• The book is *[_Modification_][book_ms]*. [BibTeX][bib_modificationbook] 
%
%• It's something between a textbook for people with a basic background in 
%  semantics and an introductory survey of work on the semantics of 
%  modification.
%
%• Feedback of any kind, however minor, would be  helpful at this stage. 
  
Below are non-final drafts of chapters as separate files. 
%I've tried to make all but the last chapter below as independent of each other as possible.
%They can mostly be read independently, except for maybe the last chapter (on crosscategorial issues). If all this is entirely new to you, though, the chapter on comparatives and degree constructions would make more sense in light of the one on vagueness, degrees, and gradability. 
A disadvantage of viewing the chapters separately is that clickable links to other chapters don't work or even display properly. 
%(To remedy that, you'll need the [full manuscript][book_ms].)

• Chapter 2. *['The Lexical Semantics of Adjectives: More Than Just
  Scales'][chapter_lexsem]*. [BibTeX][bib_chapter_notscales]
  
  [chapter_lexsem]: ../papers/chapter_notscales.pdf

  (abs): One could be forgiven for getting the impression that the semantics
  of adjectives is, above all, the semantics of scales. Yet this would be a
  misimpression, as this chapter strives to demonstrate. It is about the
  lexical semantics of adjectives, but it is *not* about scales. Section 2
  presents a typology of adjectives according the effect they have on nouns
  they modify. Section 3 sketches various theoretical approaches that shed
  light on that typology. Section 4 begins the exploration of particular
  analytically-tractable classes of adjectives, focusing on adjectives that
  interact in interesting ways with their nouns. Section 5 continues the
  exploration of adjective classes, but shifts the focus to adjectives with
  surprising scope properties. Finally, section 6 considers additional issues
  closely linked to the syntax of adjectives, including their relative order
  and the positions they can occupy.

• Chapter 3. *['Vagueness, Degrees, and Gradable 
  Predicates'][chapter_scales]*. [BibTeX][bib_chapter_scales] 
  
  [chapter_scales]: ../papers/chapter_scales.pdf

  (abs): The chapter begins with a discussion of vagueness in section 2.
  Section 3 gives a thumbnail sketch of theories of vagueness and gradability
  and explores one approach that hasn't much captured the imagination of
  formal semanticists. Sections 4 and 5 presents two approaches that have.
  Section 6 compares them, considering the question of the status the notion
  'degree' should have in the grammar. Finally, section 7 turns to scalar
  issues in the lexical semantics of adjectives.

• Chapter 4. *['Comparatives and Their Kin'][chapter_comparatives]*. 
  [BibTeX][bib_chapter_comparatives] 
  
  [chapter_comparatives]: ../papers/chapter_comparatives.pdf

  (abs): This chapter examines the semantics of comparatives and their
  grammatical relatives, such as the equative, which positively bristle with
  subtle and often vexing puzzles. These puzzles provide insight into a
  surprisingly wide array of issues: the nature of comparison, of course, but
  also the ontology of degrees, scope taking mechanisms, ellipsis, negative
  polarity items, modality, focus, type-shifting, contextual domain
  restrictions, imprecision, and semantic crosslinguistic variation. This will
  also give us an opportunity to address the syntax of the extended AP in
  earnest for the first time. Section 2 confronts the mapping between syntax
  and semantics in the adjectival extended projection, with special attention
  to the comparative. Section 3 provides a tour of other degree constructions,
  including differential comparatives, equatives, superlatives, and others.
  Section 4 is the one most directly relevant to the puzzle we began the
  chapter with: the question of why the entailments of apparently very similar
  degree constructions differ subtly. Finally, section 5 concludes with a
  discussion of the crosslinguistic picture.

• Chapter 5. *['Adverbs'][chapter_adverbs]*. 
  [BibTeX][bib_chapter_adverbs] 
  
  [chapter_adverbs]: ../papers/chapter_adverbs.pdf

  (abs): This chapter is devoted to adverbs, a highly heterogenous class of
  modifiers that present a variety of vexing problems. Section 2 considers how
  some taxonomical organization can be introduced into the chaos of adverbs.
  Section 3 then takes the first steps toward an analysis, wrestling with
  foundational compositional questions and a puzzle involving intensionality.
  Section 4 examines two classes of adverbs (manner and subject-oriented) in
  more detail. Section 5 turns to adverbs that occur higher in the clause.
  Section 6 introduces some facts and tools relevant to locative adverbials.
  Section 7 turns to the ill-understood phenomenon of adverbs as modifiers of
  adjectival projections. Section 8 mostly just sets aside temporal and
  quantificational adverbials. Section 9 concludes by revisiting the questions
  of the relative order of adverbs.

• Chapter 6. *['Crosscategorial Concerns'][chapter_crosscategorial]*. 
  [BibTeX][bib_chapter_crosscategorial] 
  
  [chapter_crosscategorial]: ../papers/chapter_crosscategorial.pdf

  (abs): This chapter considers, in light of the previous chapters, a number
  of crosscategorial phenomena not yet addressed. In section 2, we confront
  expressions that measure individuals by their amount, and the comparatives
  built out of these expressions. This requires combining our standing
  assumptions about degree semantics with assumptions and DPs an individuals.
  Section 3 examines the issue of cross-categorial gradability more broadly,
  focusing on verbs and nouns, both of which seem to be gradable in different
  ways and one of which introduces into the discussion some new parallels
  between individuals and events. Section 4 addresses the problem of
  crosscategorial modifiers that hedge or reinforce a claim, but can't be
  readily assimilated to the degree modifiers we've already encountered in
  other domains. Section 5 focuses on an issue we've systematically set aside
  throughout the book: nonrestrictive interpretations of modifiers, which turn
  out to extend far beyond relative clauses, their traditional home. Part of
  that entails struggling with what 'nonrestrictive' actually means. Finally,
  section 6 examines the phenomenon an aspect of meaning that is inherently
  subjective in a particular way, one that gives rise to the possibility of
  interlocutors contradicting each other truth-conditionally without being at
  odds with each other pragmatically.
