    abstract = {Purely numerical measure phrases (MPs) like three or two thirds, which lack a unit term, are often construed as denoting degrees on a single numerical scale. This paper examines an apparently unrecognized class of complex purely numerical MPs such as two in three and six to one, which we term composite MPS. Such MPs demonstrate, we argue, that mathematically equivalent MPs aren’t always equivalent linguistically and that different purely mathematical MPs refer to degrees on different and incommensurable scales. Indeed, some, such as sports scores, seem to refer irreducibly to tuples or pluralities of degrees. We classify composite MPs into three varieties, each of which requires a distinct analysis.},
