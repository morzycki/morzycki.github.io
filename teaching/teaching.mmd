Teaching
————————

Courses I've taught in the last several years:

	- [LING 201](201/syllabus.pdf), an undergrad introduction to syntax and 
	  semantics.
	- [LING 327](327/syllabus.pdf), an intermediate undergraduate course in 
	  semantics.
	- [LING 425/525](425525/syllabus.pdf), a mixed undergrad-grad advanced 
	  semantics course.
	- [LING 447](447/syllabus.pdf), an undergrad capstone seminar. Recent 
	  topics include the grammar of swearing (including phonology! co-taught 
	  with [Anne-Michelle Tessier](https://amtessier.github.io)); expressive 
	  meaning (largely disjoint from swearing); and degree semantics.
	- [LING 527](527/syllabus.pdf), the second course in UBC's graduate 
	  semantics sequence.
	- [LING 530](530/syllabus.pdf), a graduate research seminar course, most 
	  recently on numerals.

% And, since it's teaching-related and I can't resist, here's a link [the
% book](../work/book) again. 
 

%I don’t have teaching stuff from other courses on-line, but such things might in principle be available by email.

%If you're an undergrad wondering what one can do in life with a linguistics degree, you should probably find out and then let me know. You may want to start your research into this topic here or here.
